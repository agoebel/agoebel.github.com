&lt;p&gt;A great &lt;a href=&quot;http://writing.bryanwoods4e.com/1-poor-poor-child&quot;&gt;essay on why programming is hard&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s harder than you think. Right now you&amp;rsquo;re probably underestimating the amount of frustration and discomfort you&amp;rsquo;re about to experience, without realizing that by
doing so you&amp;rsquo;re creating all sorts of subtle barriers to obtaining a deep
understanding of programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;language-does-matter&quot;&gt;Language does matter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this part extremely true: my first language is Java. Every programming language I&amp;rsquo;ve tried since has been through comparing it to Java. I&amp;rsquo;ve had criticism of each different language based on my assumptions. Scripting languages being prone to bad coding because they are not strictly typed, having to do tedious work with languages that require memory management (my time is too valuable!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your first programming language provides you with a base vocabulary through which you begin to understand all other computer programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;programming-is-the-best-way-to-learn-programming&quot;&gt;Programming is the best way to learn programming.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also another trueism. The best people in my class in college were those who had done the most code. &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; to transfer that to industry you have to have interpersonal skills, be willing to compromise, work well in a team etc. It sounds fluffy, but once you realise how much as a team you rely on other people (and how bad code merges, bad commits can cause &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; more work)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;its-ok-to-suck-at-math-you-wont-be-using-much-anyway&quot;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s OK to suck at math; you won&amp;rsquo;t be using much anyway.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I&amp;rsquo;ve found this to be true. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the worlds greatest at math (in fact they were the classes I felt most unease at in college)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The author here is spot on about command of English. Professional programming (not necessarily what the article is about) requires a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of communication. Like I said above, interpersonal skills is without doubt the most important attribute besides being technically competent. If your customer/stakeholder/manager can&amp;rsquo;t give you a design specification or you can&amp;rsquo;t read and understand an API, you&amp;rsquo;re instantly a lot less valuable. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this in college also, a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; proficient programmer who consistently did badly even at programming modules - because he never bothered to understand what was required in each task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve commented enough, but it&amp;rsquo;s an excellent article which I find myself agreeing with all the way through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been responsible for both, bad merges and bad code. Its a fact of life and being too young and eager. You realise the value of the veterans is the cool head and measured approach they bring from years of experience.&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; rel=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Although I felt the most unease at maths, it&amp;rsquo;s mainly because of a poor attitude towards maths. I never felt confident in it until I went to college (I actually had very reasonable grades in maths modules). Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because like a lot of children and teenagers I was told I wasn&amp;rsquo;t good at maths or maybe I told myself that and actually believed it.&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; rel=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Notepad++: A Great Windows Editor</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2012/05/01/notepad-a-great-windows-editor/</link>

&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of my day in heavy development tools such as Eclipse&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but often for editing simple &lt;abbr title=&quot;eXtensible Markup Language&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/abbr&gt; I just want a quick tool to make fast changes. If I use the &lt;abbr title=&quot;Command Line Interface&quot;&gt;CLI&lt;/abbr&gt; (or Linux) it&amp;rsquo;ll be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt;, if I&amp;rsquo;m on Mac it&amp;rsquo;ll be &lt;a href=&quot;http://macromates.com/&quot;&gt;Textmate&lt;/a&gt; but on Windows it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://notepad-plus-plus.org/&quot;&gt;Notepad++&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t found an editor on Windows as clean as Notepad++ (if you use a tool professionally, you get to know it&amp;rsquo;s quirks pretty fast) for editing text of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/05/notepadplusplus.png&quot; alt=&quot;Notepad++&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people I know use awful tools that nag you each time you use them, why go through that pain? In college we used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.textpad.com/products/textpad/index.html&quot;&gt;TextPad&lt;/a&gt; for learning Java before we jumped ship to a proper &lt;abbr title=&quot;Integrated Development Environment&quot;&gt;IDE&lt;/abbr&gt; (Netbeans and Eclipse). Textpad has a lot less features then Notepad++ in my mind from using the both of them extensively. In fact the only thing textpad did better was to have a built in macro to run a java program (which can be setup in Notepad++). If you write programs, I can only ask you never touch Notepad (oh my god the wordwrap horror), so give Notepad++ a try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Eclipse is an IDE primarily for programming in the Java programming language (which is what I use).&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; rel=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I regularly watch technology podcasts and I&amp;rsquo;ve had a subscription to sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lynda.com&quot; title=&quot;Lynda Training Videos&quot;&gt;Lynda.com&lt;/a&gt;. Between those and Youtube, I&amp;rsquo;ve watched an awful lot of technology how-to videos and 90% of them are quite poor in terms of editing, sound and being coherent/properly scripted. Sometimes though it&amp;rsquo;s a joy to genuinely learn something new in a short, concise and to the point video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://revision3.com/html5player-v12777?external=true&amp;amp;width=555&amp;amp;height=312&quot; width=&quot;555&quot; height=&quot;312&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This haktip is right up there with being among the best: short, concise, to the point and about a utility that will be super-useful to me. In work I&amp;rsquo;m in an agile software development team and I spend a lot of time on the command line. I &lt;strong&gt;like&lt;/strong&gt; the command line, but many don&amp;rsquo;t (personal preference I guess). As part of being agile, we produce a lot of video demos to stakeholders. Increasingly though the demos we produce are just as useful for the team - you can&amp;rsquo;t be every team member at once and this provides huge visibility to the team of progress. Our software is a Unix product, but we develop on Windows - so Camtasia is usually used - which is fine for &lt;abbr title=&quot;Graphical User Interface&quot;&gt;GUI&lt;/abbr&gt; demos. This handy utility will be great to demo &lt;abbr title=&quot;Command Line Interface&quot;&gt;CLI&lt;/abbr&gt; stuff we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ikea the TV Business? Who would have forseen the day. After looking at their
video I must say I can see the reasons quite clearly: TV&amp;rsquo;s look awkward in 
almost everyones home. They don&amp;rsquo;t fit in our units, the cables are in awkward
 positions and you can never find the remote&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of all things cheap and
 Ikea I must confess, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be watching this development with great interest!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/17/2954230/ikea-tv-sound-furniture-autumn-release-date&quot;&gt;Ikea furniture with integrated TVs and sound systems coming this fall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/0Nm7-EuctOs&quot; title=&quot;Ikea Uppleva&quot;&gt;see the video here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; rel=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Best Cookbook</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2012/02/04/the-best-cookbook/</link>

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2012/02/04/the-best-cookbook</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently started cooking meals from scratch and it&amp;rsquo;s a worthwhile experience! By my side is an awesome cookbook produced by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2012/02/101squaremeals.png&quot; alt=&quot;101 Square Meals&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s generally all healthy food and every recipe indicates cost and portion size. It even has meals for one, meals for weaning babies, desserts, you name it! So what&amp;rsquo;s the cost of this fabulous book? I got it for free. They produce very limited quantities however, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth contacting MABS to see if you can get your hands on a copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a &lt;a title=&quot;101 Square Meals&quot; href=&quot;http://dueyfinster.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/101_sq_meals_1_.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PDF version of the same&lt;/a&gt; if you own a digital device to read it on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Very Simple Java Twitter Bot (Twitter4J)</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2012/02/01/very-simple-java-twitter-bot-twitter4j/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2012 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2012/02/01/very-simple-java-twitter-bot-twitter4j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Below is code for the start of a Twitter bot I am going to build in Java. 
It&amp;rsquo;s the most basic way of getting Oauth working (with any account, not 
just your developer account) and it shows your timeline and can update 
your status - that&amp;rsquo;s it for now. The neat thing is it uses Java&amp;rsquo;s awesome 
serialisation, so you only should have to authorise your twitter account once!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-you-will-need&quot;&gt;What you will need:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Twitter4j Libraries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oauth Consumer and Secret Key off twitter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That is it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2469810.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-the-code-does&quot;&gt;What the code does:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once only:&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Gives the user an url to visit&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;User enters a PIN provided by Twitter back in to the program&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The program gets the proper keys for the account from Twittter
and &lt;em&gt;saves them as a file&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everytime the program is restarted it reloads in account details (if
the user gave permissions in steps above - it is not redone)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User is provided with a Menu and either can update status or show
timeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started off with&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter4j.org/en/code-examples.html#oauth&quot; title=&quot;Twitter4J OAuth Example&quot;&gt;this code example&lt;/a&gt;, so much props to &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter4j.org/&quot; title=&quot;Twitter4J&quot;&gt;Twitter4J&lt;/a&gt;
team for a great library!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good insights from CES: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ericsson.com/thinkingahead/the-networked-society-blog/2012/01/18/is-4k-the-new-3d/&quot;&gt;Is 4K the new 3D? - The Networked Society Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to own a 4K screen, the more lifelike the images the better it&amp;rsquo;ll be for movies. I&amp;rsquo;d imagine filesizes are 4x as large as HD also, which will be an issue that might kill off optical storage (and require better broadband). It&amp;rsquo;s a shame the author tried to compare it to 3D (which objectively is still a flop) but he mentions the issues in that technology (namely: field of vision).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only we had such sense here in Ireland, we can&amp;rsquo;t meet our commitments and it will hurt the economy in the long run not to go nuclear. The ESB has said &amp;ldquo;sometime in the 2030&amp;rsquo;s we will need to look at it&amp;rdquo; - why not look at it now? These projects take 10-15 years at least to implement properly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Don't get a Kindle</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/12/03/dont-get-a-kindle/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2011 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/12/03/dont-get-a-kindle</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The headline is misleading - I actually love my Kindle. I have read several books I otherwise 
would have not read. What I don&amp;rsquo;t get is why otherwise well-healed and technology literate 
folk dismiss the Kindle out-of-hand. The most common reason? It&amp;rsquo;s not dead-tree paper. 
&lt;em&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t hold it&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t feel it&lt;/em&gt;. Yet the biggest thing they 
dismiss is me. It&amp;rsquo;s personal. I have an eye condition which means I wear hard plastic 
contacts all day long - my eyes get very tired, very easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Kindle is a wonderful reading device. I don&amp;rsquo;t read much books (I do most 
on-screen as I am on a computer constantly). It allows me and millions like me to 
enlarge the text and get a comfortable reading experience. I can adjust contrast 
(important when you suffer from shadowing/ghosting of an image) and much, much more. 
It also has on certain models a read-to-me computer generated voice. These advances 
cannot be dismissed and most importantly they aren&amp;rsquo;t offered by dead-tree books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure the real book is beautiful, pleasant and looks the part with its fancy 
cover. But if I can&amp;rsquo;t read it comfortably, it&amp;rsquo;s next-to-useless. And that for 
me is end of sentence, paragraph and book (paper or e).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All About Platforms</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/11/26/all-about-platforms/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2011 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/11/26/all-about-platforms</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If your passion is in technology, you often sigh with the marketing buzzwords used in sales. 
&lt;em&gt;Cloud Computing&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually mean anything specific (or could mean a lot of 
things). It&amp;rsquo;s that a lot of things to a lot of people who makes it useful as a term, an 
ideology, a way of explaining why &lt;em&gt;you-oh-so-need-to-do-this-now&lt;/em&gt;. Cloud computing 
for me is a platform description. I think of the myriad of hosting companies who offer 
a platform to build your service atop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology has been and will continue to be all about platforms. Look at Windows, the 
perfect example of an &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; platform that is actually &lt;em&gt;very, very closed&lt;/em&gt;. 
Open in the sense it makes you feel fuzzy inside with all the control you seem to have. 
But closed when the platform operator decides they need a change of direction and 
emphasis. If your smart, you realise this and either a) kick the football down the 
road or b) do your best to plan ahead. Either option is sub-optimal. What platforms 
do offer you is a foundation to build upon. They save you time, money, engineering 
talent and when they work well are indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you build the platform, you can make a lot of money. Just ask Amazon and Microsoft. 
Facebook, Twitter and Google are still ramping up their platform efforts. Adobe has 
just announced the realised their very valuable Flash platform is dead on mobile devices. 
They realised platforms are very purpose specific (to be valuable) and that value is in 
the already-mature desktop market - the investment in mobile wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth it. Adobe 
has always made money from the tools (as has Microsoft, apart from selling the 
platform Windows they sell Office, Sharepoint etc) and is focusing on targeting a 
larger platform in HTML5. If Adobe succeeds they&amp;rsquo;ll make a lot more money, or even 
if they capture a small section of the market which is bigger then the previous 
flash creation tools market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monetisation is also tricky for platforms. Amazon&amp;rsquo;s strategy is similar to Wal-Mart, 
make it big, reliable and cheap. Only big companies can ever compete with Amazon on 
that scale. Smaller companies must rely on getting as many people to their platform 
as possible (to get as big) or creating a niche in say highly regulated environments 
which are high value but low volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: Platforms are good, but know when to jump off !&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hollywood Tech</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/11/22/hollywood-tech/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2011 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/11/22/hollywood-tech</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I always enjoy watching shows like CSI for the over-the-top depiction of current technology. 
They obviously have people in know, it&amp;rsquo;s not like the script writers of major shows cannot 
get someone to consult them on technology (or maybe they don&amp;rsquo;t - &lt;em&gt;sometimes I do wonder&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video below is about IRC (Internet Relay Chat). They are correct it&amp;rsquo;s primitive (it&amp;rsquo;s all text) 
and hackers do actually use it (groups like Anonymous), but you can&amp;rsquo;t track someone to their 
living room using just an IP address!! The montage about the boats trying to explain how 
IRC works is off-the-wall insane crazy. &lt;strong&gt;WHY?!?&lt;/strong&gt;, alas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2rGTXHvPCQ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I found the gem below, where an assistant says she&amp;rsquo;ll &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Create a GUI in Visual Basic 
to track the killers IP address&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. And while she&amp;rsquo;s creating that Graphical User 
interface, anyone in the know can only assume the killer used that time to get away! 
No-one creates a GUI to display a number, all you can track is already on the web with 
a quick search for &amp;ldquo;IP Lookup&amp;rdquo;. This is a buzz-word fest to seem very high-tech!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU&amp;amp;w=560&amp;amp;h=315]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But having said all of that, these videos are &lt;em&gt;very entertaining&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Faster with Arch</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/11/19/faster-with-arch/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Nov 2011 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/11/19/faster-with-arch</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently switched my main desktop over to Arch Linux. If you have never heard about Arch Linux, 
it is a &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;roll your own&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; Linux distribution. This basically means from start to finish, the whole 
process is custom. Whether your system has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or sound is totally up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I switched from Ubuntu Linux, which is very much built for new people to Linux. I have been using Ubuntu 
since it&amp;rsquo;s release in 2004 (as old as this blog incidentally). I have found it slowly moving away from my 
power user needs from the release of the KDE 4.0 desktop up to the recently introduced Unity desktop for 
Ubuntu. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong I love the whizz-bang effects of the snazzier distributions (like Ubuntu) and 
have used it to show people the power of Linux (and how really groundbreaking Compiz effects were at the 
time, ~2005). It&amp;rsquo;s sad Compiz hasn&amp;rsquo;t got the kudos but since both Windows and OS X have copied from Compiz, 
some more usability has been gained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But alas these features aren&amp;rsquo;t really for me. I work professionally with computers all day and what matters 
to me most now are speed and efficiency. I am not productive if a desktop issue causes a slow-down (as Aero 
often does on Windows) or even a crash (Mac spinning beach ball, anyone?). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; important reason why I switched to Arch itself is because of the rolling 
release feature. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have set releases like Ubuntu (every six months) but updates constantly. 
This suits my workflow a lot better because a lot of software I use on Linux gets very regular updates 
now (Chromium, Eclipse, Calibre, Firefox, Amarok, etc). I also hate upgrades between releases and I 
think smaller more manageable updates (even if small issues arise) will provide a much better experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all there&amp;rsquo;s only so much coffee you can drink when your machine is taking a long time to respond!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Website Improvements</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/11/01/site-improv/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2011 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/11/01/site-improv</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been posting much lately because I have been 
working hard to improve the experience of visiting this
website. You may ask &lt;em&gt;what does that mean?&lt;/em&gt; - well it is
simple. I love going to websites that are uncluttered, 
provide useful information and are to the point. It&amp;rsquo;s
also small things like having a really fast page load
time. So here&amp;rsquo;s a flavour of some of what I have 
been working on lately&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;navigation-improvements&quot;&gt;Navigation improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brand new menu, which can hold nested menus, images 
and more (much more flexible).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proper &lt;a href=&quot;/sitemap.xml&quot; title=&quot;Neil Grogan's Sitemap&quot;&gt;Sitemap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/atom.xml&quot; title=&quot;Neil Grogan's Atom Feed&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/rss.xml&quot; title=&quot;Neil Grogan's RSS Feed&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accessibility keys can now be used to navigate to 
every page on the menu (for screen readers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;speed-improvements&quot;&gt;Speed improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blockquotes are now 100% &lt;acronym title=&quot;Cascading Style Sheets&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/acronym&gt; - no images. Other post 
 elements will follow when CSS3 allows.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am in the process of downsizing all images 
to thumbnail size (as a bonus if you click on 
it you&amp;rsquo;ll get beautiful full size image goodness)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maintainability-improvements&quot;&gt;Maintainability Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All posts are now written in Markdown, which is like plain 
text. Makes me updating old posts with bad info way easier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The history of every page &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dueyfinster/dueyfinster.github.com&quot; title=&quot;My Github Repo&quot;&gt;in the repository&lt;/a&gt; and can 
be referenced and restored (indeed I use it to constantly 
roll out and back changes/improvements).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Permalinks will be provided at the end of each page. Posts 
can be safely linked to now and should always work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve started adopting &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/&quot; title=&quot;Microformats&quot;&gt;Microformats&lt;/a&gt; around the site as 
a way to feed search engines and crawlers more useful information 
on both myself and the websites content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Similiar to Microformats, I&amp;rsquo;ve marked up posts so services 
such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readability.com/&quot; title=&quot;Readability&quot;&gt;Readability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instapaper.com/&quot; title=&quot;Instapaper&quot;&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; should have no 
trouble parsing out all the stuff they don&amp;rsquo;t need (such 
as site navigation, comments etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Images are getting or will have alternative tags for the 
visually impaired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and more to come&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still going to be a lot of broken posts for various 
reasons - I am doing my best to review and update as many as 
I can. Unfortunately changing blogging platform and having 150+ 
posts (since 2004) doesn&amp;rsquo;t make updates easy, but once things 
are fixed I&amp;rsquo;ll have a better idea of how to avoid such mess 
in future. Do &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; if you see any I have missed!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reflection on 9-11</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/09/12/nerf-war/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2011 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/09/12/nerf-war</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been 10 years since the anniversary of 9/11 and much of the world has
changed a lot in that period. We&amp;rsquo;ve had full body scanners at airports,
marshalls on flights, bombs hidden in toner cartridges and two wars. I
reflected on this and remembered two really good articles I&amp;rsquo;ll share here
on the topic. Hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ve changed for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yesterday I finally wrote something that&amp;rsquo;s been bothering me for about ten years: 
The fact that Al Qaeda can&amp;rsquo;t be as big and bad as it&amp;rsquo;s made out to be, 
because its whole design violates every rule of guerrilla organisation. 
It&amp;rsquo;s like a counter intelligence officer&amp;rsquo;s dream, 
the Al Qaeda plan to bring guerrillas from all over the world, 
introduce them to each other, and exchange funds, material and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It was pure cowardice that kept me from saying that sooner. 
A good lesson for me in not listening to the majority. The majority, the media, 
whatever you want to call it-maybe &amp;ldquo;the background noise&amp;rdquo; is the best way to describe it-kept 
saying that Al Qaeda was the biggest baddest thing in history and even though I grumbled and 
held back a little, I bought into that idea way more than I should, knowing the way I did that 
everything about their set-up pointed to a flash in the pan-which is what they&amp;rsquo;ve turned out to be.
Back in 2005, when the Al Qaeda hoax was hitting its peak, I wrote a column called &amp;ldquo;Nerf War and 
Real War: Al Qaeda vs. IRA.&amp;rdquo; If you want a good quick lesson in why dummies like me have such a 
hard time understanding guerrilla warfare, even when they&amp;rsquo;ve got all the info they need right 
in front of them, just read that article. I re-read it yesterday, after a reader pointed out that 
I&amp;rsquo;d praised Al Qaeda for going all out and was being inconsisent in yesterday&amp;rsquo;s blog for saying 
they blew their assets. - &lt;a href=&quot;http://exiledonline.com/wn-38-ira-vs-al-qaeda-i-was-wrong/&quot;&gt;WN 38 IRA VS. AL QAEDA: I WAS WRONG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the disaster, the sheer demand for information sent news site after news site 
crashing down, especially in the US, leaving the world once more glued to the telly for the up-to-the-minute 
details of what was taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Register did its best. Generally, the site stayed up, and in response to email requests from Americans 
who were stuck at work, Reg hacks posted rolling updates, sourced from TV and radio, as the disaster unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Ten years on, things have changed. For starters, internet infrastructure is much more robust. In 2011, the 
internet still hasn&amp;rsquo;t beaten TV for serving up breaking news, but it&amp;rsquo;s at least an equal player now, with news 
organizations trawling Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and personal blogs to find out what is happening on the ground.
- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/11/9_11_ten_years_on/&quot;&gt;Ten years after the Twin Towers: What&amp;rsquo;s the Reg angle?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review of the Motorola Xoom Wifi</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/08/27/review-of-motorola-xoom-wifi/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2011 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/08/27/review-of-motorola-xoom-wifi</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently bought the wifi version of the Motorola Xoom. I did not get the 3G version to 
keep costs down (no second carrier subscription in addition to smartphone I own). Here&amp;rsquo;s 
my review, let it be noted I&amp;rsquo;ve been an iOS user since version 2 (iPhone 3G) and although 
I have used devices from Android 1.6 and up - I&amp;rsquo;ve never &amp;lsquo;lived&amp;rsquo; with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/files/2011/08/Mot_Xoom_Wiki_jeh.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Motorola Xoom&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/08/Mot_Xoom_Wiki_jeh.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Motorola Xoom Tablet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Motorola Xoom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aesthetics--design&quot;&gt;Aesthetics &amp;amp; Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all the design is very well executed. It looks and feels like a premium tablet 
should (should that be iPad competitor?). The ports are a clear winner and still are over
any other tablet. I haven&amp;rsquo;t got the video dock yet, but I ampositiveit&amp;rsquo;ll be 
a great addition to my big HDTV. The only gripe really is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t charge through 
usb, which I believe is because it has two batteries. It charges through supplied plug 
insanely fast! It lasts all day and then some with heavy use also. I haven&amp;rsquo;t left the 
thing alone long enough to test the standby time, but I am sure it&amp;rsquo;s good also. The 10.1&amp;rdquo; 
screen feels like the &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo; size for a tablet and I&amp;rsquo;ll besurprisedif more 
tablets don&amp;rsquo;t end up adopting a screen size closer to the Xoom&amp;rsquo;s. The heft is a bit much,
I would like it to be a small bit lighter - but nearly all tablets with proper glass 
screens will be heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;android-3---honeycomb&quot;&gt;Android 3 - Honeycomb!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honeycomb is wonderfully designed and feels just like the Xoom - premium. I am a user 
of Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and now Android, so I never find the perfect experience 
anywhere and love bits of each. There are a few things iOS has me trained to expect, 
which I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten in Android. One of my biggest frustrations at the moment is a 
lack of background video - iOS has this down and then some. The other is the really 
nice design of applications - one can&amp;rsquo;t hide the fact most Android apps feel less 
premium. Having said that the tablet market is still young, and I just found a beautifully
designed purpose-built Honeycomb podcasting client - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beyondpod.mobi/&quot;&gt;BeyondPod&lt;/a&gt; (an example of 
following Honeycomb layout).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honeycomb is as has been described in the multiple
review sites I consulted - tron-like in feeling. It&amp;rsquo;s got that cool unhealthy blue glow
that looks a bit futuristic. It&amp;rsquo;s still buggy around the edges and mostsurprisingly
this affects the Google applications more, some are still being updated (Gmail, Reader).
Like the iPad but better is the ability to either zoom or stretch applications made
for the phone for the big screen. This made many 3rd party apps run flawlessly - 
most noticeably all the games with their custom user interfaces looked just as good 
if not better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;app-store-vs-market&quot;&gt;App Store vs. Market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll spill the beans here: I started looking for apps I already knew from my iPhone
on the Xoom. Surprisingly, I found the vast majority of them. Apple&amp;rsquo;s App Store 
exclusives are getting rarer it seems. Overall my feel is this: App store has better
quality apps, all useful apps are pretty much paid (bar top shelf free ones - 
Dropbox, Twitter etc). Android Market has mostly free for anything you need (at a
lesser quality) BUT the top quality apps (like BeyondPod) are more expensive. My 
gut tells me App Store will cost you more over time, while the Android Market prices
make you question if you really need the app (for really good apps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall a fantastic device. I would buy it now that the price has come down if:
 You don&amp;rsquo;t mind upgrading again in a year or two (iPad the same), use and like 
Android and think you would like the option to mess with the device by developing/rooting.
It&amp;rsquo;s great hardware and because it&amp;rsquo;s Google certified it&amp;rsquo;ll follow all the releases of 
Honeycomb which is sure to get more exciting as competition to the iPad heats up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall 8/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plantronics .655 USB Headset Review</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/08/16/usb-headset-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2011 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/08/16/usb-headset-review</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got a Plantronics .655 USB Headset mainly for the ability to do VOIP well. 
Those of you who come here often know &lt;a href=&quot;http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/03/review.html&quot;&gt;I reviewed Sennheiser HD595 before&lt;/a&gt;, 
which is a headset built for the quality of reproduction (I use that one for music).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s not much you can say about a VOIP headset, so I am going to keep this short! 
The Plantronics .655 USB isn&amp;rsquo;t the most comfortable headset and the usb connection 
seemed like a plus as I&amp;rsquo;d never owned a USB headset. The mic quality is a lot better 
with the USB connection (though I am guessing 90% is down to the fact it&amp;rsquo;s directional 
and pointed at your mouth), but the sound won&amp;rsquo;t be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plantronics has basically discontinued this product although you can still buy it. 
If price is an issue, I recommend this as a decent headset, if not a tad disappointing 
in the comfort stakes. Plantronics have newer models out similar to this - some more 
expensive and some cheaper. If the price point is a winner, they offer decent value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I try to listen to as many &lt;strike&gt;podcasts&lt;/strike&gt; (&lt;em&gt;netcasts?&lt;/em&gt;) as I can. 
They fall in to two categories: Irish radio and technology.  Luckily, there is 
so much competition in this space it&amp;rsquo;s hard to pick the best - so quality is high!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I am a big FLOSS advocate and have discovered so many cool and

  &lt;p&gt;Steve Gibson (of Gibson Research) is Bruce Schneier of the tech

security focused (but that is his strength). 
&lt;em&gt;His episodes on how computers work are a must listen&lt;/em&gt; and make 
complex technical things easy to understand (although as Comp Sci 
Major I did disagree with some things he said/missed out on!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Software Engineering Job</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/06/13/software-engineering-job/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2011 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/06/13/software-engineering-job</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had been applying for jobs since I started my last year in college 
and I am delighted to say even before I completed my final year, I 
have gained full time employment. I would say it is luck, but my family 
thinks it&amp;rsquo;s down to a lot of hard work and good grades! Either way, it&amp;rsquo;s 
a great feeling in probably the most competitive jobs market (for potential 
employees) in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job is Software Engineering on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ericsson.com/hr/services/competence/course_umts/LZU-108_6863_en.pdf&quot;&gt;Java-based Cellular network control 
technology which Ericsson specialises in&lt;/a&gt;. I have obviously signed an 
NDA (and will honour it) and at this point it goes without saying all the 
viewpoints from this website are entirely my own and nothing to do with 
Ericsson in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll still blog about technology, but I am 
looking forward on taking on a mobile industry slant, not necessarily about 
Ericsson. My final year project and thesis were all about the mobile software 
arena, so the mesh was perfect and I have a big interest in the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very hard to believe this blog is 7 years in existence already! I have 
begun a process of cleaning up old posts (marking links as broken etc). Reading 
over old posts from secondary school to all the way through college and on to 
full time employment is a wonderful journey and I hope to mark the 10 year anniversary 
in 2014 with many posts about the mobile industry, just as I have through college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s to many more years! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you read this, I have already embarked on an inter-railing 
trip around Europe. Some of the cities in the itinerary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cologne&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nürburgring (Rock Am Ring festival)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prague&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bratislava&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely post up some pictures when I get back. I planned 
this trip with a few classmates to coincide with the completion of 
our four year honours degree in Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Final Year of Honours Degree, Complete</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a whirlwind four years, but this day marks the cessation 
of my full-time education for my honours degree. It is an overwhelming 
feeling of relief, joy, sadness and all of the emotions you feel when 
leaving an institution that has been a huge part of my life, if only for 
four short years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://picasaweb.google.com/102276623719467794879/BloggerPictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCMSGwsXrra72MQ#5604530193920577826&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;296&quot; src=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Wq0iRacWX8o/TcdKhG2WUSI/AAAAAAAAAoo/TOqP7IlgyYg/s400/0.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; margin-top: 5px;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of my course has been without doubt, the friends for life I have made. 
I include everyone in my class in this, but some friends have been truly the 
best anyone could wish for. I dedicate this post to wishing all my classmates 
the very best in whatever they chose to do and hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll all keep in touch!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an old box which contained a Nokia phone from a now 
defunct Esat Digifone. Irish Businessman &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_O%27Brien&quot;&gt;Denis O&amp;rsquo;Brien&lt;/a&gt; 
started it and sold it to BT and made a fortune (and after got 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moriarty_Tribunal#Esat_Digifone&quot;&gt;embroiled in a tribunal on accusations of impropriety&lt;/a&gt;). 
It is now called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O2_%28Ireland%29&quot;&gt;O2&lt;/a&gt;.I thought we got ripped off now with 
call charges now, how nostalgia can prove one wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Below is a neat trick to clean out your Playstation 3&amp;rsquo;s fans if 
they become a bit noisy. Before I have used a can of compressed air, 
but this method is really neat and definitely lowered the fan sound 
emanating from my PS3.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/05/09/geocampus</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my final year project, I have done a web application on the 
concept of replacing traditional web applications. I picked an area 
I  was deeply interested in, smart phones. I am an avid iPhone user 
and I  have bought Android phones also, they are great devices I can&amp;rsquo;t 
imagine  not having now that they are here. As part of my thesis I 
touched on the  old way to develop apps, using Symbian C++ or J2ME and 
we&amp;rsquo;ve come a  long, long way since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested, 
I will  publish copy of my thesis after November 2011. I won&amp;rsquo;t publish 
it here  just yet, as the examiners have yet to pour over the contents 
and grade it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://picasaweb.google.com/102276623719467794879/BloggerPictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCMSGwsXrra72MQ#5604735688705092290&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; id=&quot;:current_picnik_image&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZjPrLCe0dew/TcgGdMkbsYI/AAAAAAAAAow/3VF3PWW8n04/s1600/13943267606_PpNV6.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 5px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of Summary Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;
* Web Apps are definitely desirable, in some cases preferable
* Limited API access in the browser (only Geo-location API possible) really hampers good quality 
		applications
* Web Apps for the moment should stick to being &amp;ldquo;Magazine&amp;rdquo; -type  applications, with intelligent 
		and innovative display of information
* The tool-kits/libraries and IDE&amp;rsquo;s really aren&amp;rsquo;t up to scratch just  yet. Things are improving, 
		very slowly though. This area needs a lot  more work from stake holders.
* Prediction: WebGL (an effort to bring 3D) will really drive the push of web apps in next few 
		years (as it did with PC&amp;rsquo;s)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s going to be interesting over the next few years to see how this space 
evolves. Will it just be iOS and Android with native apps for  each? Will 
we see the market heavily fragmented and thus give web apps the opportunity 
to shine?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sennheiser HD595 Review</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/03/05/senn-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2011 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/03/05/senn-review</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During last summer I purchased a set of Sennheiser HD595&amp;rsquo;s - a 
great product for Audiophiles. I have to say for someone who constantly 
listens to a lot of music - good headphones like these are a must. They 
are expensive for sure, but Sennheiser do seem to have a great durability 
and solid build quality. This is my first set of such high quality headphones, 
so bear that in mind - I can&amp;rsquo;t speak for other manufacturers in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest and most valuable aspect is the wear time of these headphones. Any 
other cheap headphones I&amp;rsquo;ve bought, I&amp;rsquo;d always feel after 20-30 minutes my 
ears would be burning. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget these long periods of wear until 
you have a very long Skype call. You start to wish the call was over to rest 
your poor ears! The selling point of this particular model is that they are 
faithful to the sound that&amp;rsquo;s meant to be heard. Surely that&amp;rsquo;s what you want to hear? 
For some people that&amp;rsquo;s not the case and you&amp;rsquo;ll find them buying Dr. Dre or 
Skullcandies finest set of headphones and to be honest more power to them! But 
for myself, I  want faithful reproduction and not headphones targeted at a 
certain genre - HD595&amp;rsquo;s prove a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4777334194_0bba662131.jpg&quot; title=&quot;An Example of Sennheiser Headphones. (Photo credit: gcg2009)&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/03/senn.jpg&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;Sennheiser Headphones&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compensate for the lack of targeting of genres, I&amp;rsquo;ve found it necessary to use 
an equalizer once or twice - but mainly to satisfy my need for bass or drum cymbals 
and reinforce the beat of a song that&amp;rsquo;s probably on too loud for my own good anyway. 
Normal people shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be this fussy, but then again most people don&amp;rsquo;t spend this 
amount of coin on headphones (as one work colleague remarked to me: Your mad! - after 
hearing the cost, he liked the &amp;lsquo;phones though). The benchmark song I usually use is the 
Robert Miles classic &amp;ldquo;Children&amp;rdquo;. I think if you can hear all the fine intricacies of 
that song, your getting fairly good sound reproduction, in my humble opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end all I really wanted was a portable alternative to my Creative 7.1 surround 
sound system (which I reviewed here a few years back) but having said that I was under 
no illusion headphones could replace a very-powerful, room oriented acoustics. HD595&amp;rsquo;s 
do the best job I could have ask of them - but one major gripe is the are not portable 
music player friendly. Why? 6.3mm as the default jack with a clumsy 6.3 to 3.5mm jack 
and the extremely long cord included in the pack. It&amp;rsquo;s great to dock at a desk and with 
the included dock adaptor it&amp;rsquo;s more clearly aimed at this type of market. Or maybe Guitar 
players with the jack size? I imagine it&amp;rsquo;s probably good for electric guitar players, but 
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know being allergic to instruments unfortunately. The openear design (it has 
holes to allow sound escape at the side of your ears) certainly improves listening, but 
will annoy anyone near enough to hear it, so &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; forget these for commuting!! Overall 
a great buy if you plan to use them as much as I have and will.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>iPhone 4 Review</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/02/18/iphone4-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2011 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/02/18/iphone4-review</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I purchased the iPhone 4 shortly after its release in Summer 2010. 
I have obviously been so quick to review this device,  the iPhone 5 
is upon us! My philosophy for reviewing items is you &lt;strong&gt;have to live with them&lt;/strong&gt;. 
Well boy have I lived with my iPhone 4! As I write this on it, I do 
marvel at how good the hardware is. I&amp;rsquo;ve dropped this extremely expensive 
device on occasions &lt;i&gt;too numerous to count&lt;/i&gt;, so luckily it is designed well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;apps&quot;&gt;Apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5288/5318056503_a6a2a689df.jpg&quot; title=&quot;iPhone 4 by marc.flores on flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/02/iphone4.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;iPhone 4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
I have a very large collection of paid apps, two-thirds of which have been 
impulse buy, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll need them someday types. It&amp;rsquo;s a very expensive 
platform to get involved with, for sure - but the quality of some apps 
has been far better than their desktop counterparts - the one that 
springs to mind is Tweetie (now Twitter for iPhone). Some unforgettable 
games that take great advantage of the platform have sprung up - my 
favourite by far is Cut the Rope. Another is Angry Birds. None of these 
or any games I&amp;rsquo;ve played have made really good use of the iPhone 4&amp;rsquo;s 
sensors of which there are many - Gyroscope, Accelerometer, Compass, 
Camera etc.  Sure I&amp;rsquo;ve played driving games but I always feel stupid 
using the iPhone as a mock steering wheel. If you&amp;rsquo;re an app junkie like 
myself, check out AppAdvice (yes another app) for nice and easy reviews. 
I&amp;rsquo;ve also found Lifehacker hive five series for iOS help inform me when 
there&amp;rsquo;s a number of popular apps for a platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;camera&quot;&gt;Camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best features of the iPhone 4 is without a doubt the camera. 
It&amp;rsquo;ll obviously never replace an&amp;nbsp;SLR and my compact point and 
shoot HP Camera is still better but that&amp;rsquo;s all negated by the ease 
of use of iPhone camera. It&amp;rsquo;s with you all the time and has the 
best sharing tools (and quick editing tools) of any camera out there. 
Great Camera related apps include Flickr, Instagram, Toonpaint and 
the included Photos app. I&amp;rsquo;ve shared more photos directly on a one-to-one 
basis than ever before, usually after I take the picture with my iPhone - 
someone requests it and I mail it or upload to Flickr or Instagram seamlessly. 
It&amp;rsquo;s definitely the future of photos, the past was hovering around 
a device or printed photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People still are in awe of the iPhone 4 and personally I don&amp;rsquo;t think 
that&amp;rsquo;s justified or justifiable any more. Yes its beautiful hardware 
and software, but the competition has caught up to Apple. It&amp;rsquo;s still 
the best out there as far as I can see, but by that measure it&amp;rsquo;s also 
far too expensive. I&amp;rsquo;ve used mine for App development and even still, 
as a power user, I think the price is the single biggest turn off. 
iPhones do hold their value, which is a relief, should you wish to 
switch platforms or upgrade to iPhone 5. So my recommendation? If you 
have iPhone lust - buy one - but be ruthless and be willing to sell it 
on within 12 months to get something better&amp;hellip; that something is up to 
you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts on IPv6</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/02/09/thoughts-on-ipv6/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Feb 2011 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/02/09/thoughts-on-ipv6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A multitude of websites have been reporting the impending doom 
of ipv4 exhaustion, which is going to happen soon. All the top 
level address&amp;rsquo; will be gone, but the regional registries will 
still have stocks of address&amp;rsquo; in to 2011. As a user of ipv6, I 
thought I could share sone thoughts/insights on the events ahead&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a very good video which one of my favourite tech shows, 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://hak5.org/&quot;&gt;Hak5&lt;/a&gt; made with an IPv6 Consultant, Joe Klein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/cl4cEbPayek&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own experience has been straightforward on the set up side 
of things. We had to purchase an Apple Airport Extreme router 
however, which is the biggest pain in the transition, the &lt;strong&gt;cost.&lt;/strong&gt; 
Most home routers do not have proper IPv6 capability, a serious 
problem. This will cost the Internet Service providers a lot of 
money in keeping these old routers &lt;em&gt;shielded&lt;/em&gt; from the ever 
increasing IPv6 enabled websites and services - to the point at 
which a large scale upgrade may well be cheaper, but this is not 
likely to happen in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setup-of-ipv6&quot;&gt;Setup of IPv6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2072/2261404319_51bbec44ab.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Data centers will be one of the first to be all IPv6. (Photo credit: dbarsky)&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2011/02/datacenter.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Data Center LAN Cabling&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The funny thing with IPv6 is that machines self issue address&amp;rsquo; and 
can use them locally if you have an IPv6 capable router, defaulting 
to IPv4 when going through your NAT to the Internet. So it&amp;rsquo;s the 
bridge to your ISP is the issue. Where I set it up, my ISP is 
small and has no IPv6 support. I emailed them about it, to get 
no response. It&amp;rsquo;s probably worth trying again since most ISP&amp;rsquo;s 
are running trials now, and you may get a router upgrade if you 
opt-in now. So I had to set up a tunnel, using the excellent 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://he.net/&quot;&gt;Hurricane Electric&lt;/a&gt;. My ISP is slow though (average 
1mbps rural wireless) and when the tunnel is set up &lt;strong&gt;all 
traffic defaults to IPv6&lt;/strong&gt;, it makes it even slower. 
&lt;em&gt;Tunnels are not ideal&lt;/em&gt; because the result will always depend 
on the quality of connection to your tunnel provider and the 
overhead that provides. Since IPv6 packets are bigger than IPv4 
packets, your going to get a lot more IPv4 packets for the same 
volume of traffic, the major downside of tunneling. Tunnels are 
good to get some IPv6 experience, but not much else unless you 
have a very fast connection. The transition itself will probably 
look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tunnels are set up, small contained IPv6 networks exist (&lt;strong&gt;already happend&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IPv6 islands merge, major ISP&amp;rsquo;s peer and inter-network communication switches to IPv6 (&lt;strong&gt;happening now&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ISP&amp;rsquo;s start to use 4to6 tunnels to get to the IPv6 part of the Internet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ISP&amp;rsquo;s switch equipment and use 6to4 tunnels to get to ever decreasing IPv4 Internet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Like Usenet, ISPs state there is no demand for IPv4, and drop it to be fully native IPv6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;d advise anyone right now who has the patience and the interest to 
invest time in IPv6, it&amp;rsquo;s a game-changing technology, not necessarily 
better but a must to have knowledge of. As I mentioned earlier Hurricane 
Electric provide &lt;a href=&quot;http://tunnelbroker.net/&quot;&gt;free tunnels&lt;/a&gt; (you can even set it up on a 
single computer if your router can&amp;rsquo;t support IPv6) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ipv6.he.net/certification&quot;&gt;free certification&lt;/a&gt; 
to test these skills.&lt;/p&gt;

needed to output a certain percentage of a log file, but 
no more and no less. This was in Linux using bash, so I 
had a go at writing a solution, which you see below. Posting

      <title>Blogging like a H4x0r</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/01/31/blogging-like-h4x0r/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2011 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2011/01/31/blogging-like-h4x0r</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apologies to those visiting my site recently because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It hasn&amp;rsquo;t been updated recently&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have been changing hosts with it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain both of these! I have been searching for a good 
blogging engine ever since I have started blogging. I have yet 
to find the perfect one :) Some have come close in completeness 
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;) or price and ease of use (blogger), but none 
has been all-encompassing. I messed around with a blogging engine 
called &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; about a year and a half ago, but I never ended 
up deploying it. I had my website most recently on Google Sites, 
and the ease of use was pretty good, but themes-wise it was pretty 
frustrating, also they force an ugly footer on all pages, yuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I have made the switch to Jekyll, mainly 
because I have got the ultimate &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt; factor in the setup 
of all this. I write all of my posts in plaintext, like Notepad 
(for reference for Windows users out there). This means in 100 
years time they&amp;rsquo;ll still be readable (if anyone so wishes to read 
them). I&amp;rsquo;ve seen enough computer formats to know each one of them 
suck in some way. Plain text just sucks that little bit less because 
it&amp;rsquo;s been around since the dawn of computer time (bar weird encoding, 
which is sorted now I hope with UTF standard). It also simplifies 
my switch away from Jekyll, which I have learned is the &lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; 
important feature of any blogging platform. Jekyll takes this text, 
combines it with some nice visual cruft you see all around the text 
and makes it nicely readable. As it transfers it in to folders as html, 
&lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; web server software can serve this website. Making it plain 
html also makes it &lt;strong&gt;lightning&lt;/strong&gt; fast to load (since there is no 
PHP or other dynamic languages being used).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at this point your saying - okay? so what? Well the cool part is 
I use Git to save all my hard work, making undo actions to this 
website (I would say mistakes, but I don&amp;rsquo;t make any :) ) extremely 
easy and fast! Also is the coolness of Dropbox, my whole generated 
Jekyll site is synced to my server to be displayed here as it&amp;rsquo;s 
finished. So it&amp;rsquo;s very, very fast in almost every respect and it&amp;rsquo;s 
backed up like crazy and I use my favourite text editor (in a 
terminal shell if I need) to edit all this loveliness. I was 
partly inspired to do all of this &lt;a href=&quot;http://metajack.im/2009/01/23/blogging-with-git-emacs-and-jekyll/&quot;&gt;by this blog post&lt;/a&gt;, 
which I&amp;rsquo;d seen back in 2009 when I was researching Jekyll. 
Although the work in this system is in the setup, it is super 
easy to use once set up. I can even create posts on my iPhone, 
using the many apps which hook in to Dropbox to edit files stored 
there. If you ever wanted to know, that&amp;rsquo;s blogging like a h4x0r!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Wq0iRacWX8o/TOpquOK6RLI/AAAAAAAAAlE/oGVd0x63zCc/s200/20001.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom&quot;&gt;Adblock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
- Blocks ads just like Firefox extension and makes the web less junky to
look at. You can whitelist good ads, and an argument could be had your
harming websites revenue stream, but a lot of nasty tricks such as
spyware, malware have used ads as a vector to spread. Not least the
dishonesty some sites use in splitting up articles in to 10 pages to
pump ad revenue.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Wq0iRacWX8o/TOpsbEDdBMI/AAAAAAAAAlI/4yyhlRHjWN0/s1600/1001.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Wq0iRacWX8o/TOpsbEDdBMI/AAAAAAAAAlI/4yyhlRHjWN0/s200/1001.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/flcpelgcagfhfoegekianiofphddckof&quot;&gt;KB SSL
Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
- If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what https or ssl means don&amp;rsquo;t worry. All it is
encrypted webpages which protect your information between you and that
website. Commonly used in banking online, it is now spreading to sites
like Facebook, Gmail, Twitter and the like as a more secure way to
protect your information. This extension turns it on without you even
noticing!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Wq0iRacWX8o/TOptLMtECVI/AAAAAAAAAlM/lKZxQOuCSic/s1600/37001.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Wq0iRacWX8o/TOptLMtECVI/AAAAAAAAAlM/lKZxQOuCSic/s200/37001.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gieohaicffldbmiilohhggbidhephnjj&quot;&gt;Vanilla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
- not that nice flavour of ice-cream! - A Cookie Whitelist Manager that
helps protect your privacy. Automatically removes unwanted cookies.What
are cookies? Little text files that website use to remember who you are.
It&amp;rsquo;s okay if you have an account and log in, but the trouble arises when
nefarious people use it to track which sites you visit.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Wq0iRacWX8o/TOpt6YGE4NI/AAAAAAAAAlQ/aaP-cKSfGlg/s1600/7001.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Wq0iRacWX8o/TOpt6YGE4NI/AAAAAAAAAlQ/aaP-cKSfGlg/s200/7001.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bdglbbcbmgnimogcmcdenggkpdmihlga&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bookmark
Sentry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
- A bookmark scanner that checks for duplicate and bad links. I imported
100&amp;rsquo;s of bookmarks from firefox collected over about 4/5 years at least.
Websites change, move content, you can accidentally bookmark a website
twice. This helps get your bookmarks working for you and being useful
again!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Wq0iRacWX8o/TOpuju8uxmI/AAAAAAAAAlU/ixHy8DVu-Uo/s1600/32001.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Wq0iRacWX8o/TOpuju8uxmI/AAAAAAAAAlU/ixHy8DVu-Uo/s200/32001.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bmdgmondalbgpbiceiahbfpjddegdoci&quot;&gt;Site to
Phone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
- sends links from your browser to your phone or tablet - be it Android,
Nokia, or Apple iOS device. You bookmark a page on your mobile device
and install this nifty extension in Chrome, when you click the button,
next time you open that page on your mobile deivce, it will open it
automatically.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Wq0iRacWX8o/TOpvcfcZ-TI/AAAAAAAAAlY/PkpwmomhhAU/s1600/18001.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Wq0iRacWX8o/TOpvcfcZ-TI/AAAAAAAAAlY/PkpwmomhhAU/s200/18001.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ckibcdccnfeookdmbahgiakhnjcddpki&quot;&gt;Webpage
Screenshot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
- does what it says on the tin, but can take a screenshot of the whole
page of a website, no nasty scrolling and trying to stitch to halves of
a screenshot together, works like magic!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Wq0iRacWX8o/TOpwAgriu4I/AAAAAAAAAlc/HLDYUnoD-gs/s1600/1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Wq0iRacWX8o/TOpwAgriu4I/AAAAAAAAAlc/HLDYUnoD-gs/s200/1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/lcncmkcnkcdbbanbjakcencbaoegdjlp&quot;&gt;Google SSL Web
Search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
- protects your web searches from prying eyes. Can use an option in
Chrome or be set as the main search engine.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About:Flags (Chrome Beta only for now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Most people won&amp;rsquo;t know about Chrome&amp;rsquo;s about:flags (open a new tab, enter
about:flags, hit enter), similiar to Firefox&amp;rsquo;s about:config and possibly
just as dangerous, it presents &amp;ldquo;under the hood&amp;rdquo; options normal users
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to touch. Some of them are very cool to use and will no
doubt cement Chrome&amp;rsquo;s market share gains. Here&amp;rsquo;s my favourites:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tab Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: Enables Expose like Mac OS X interfaces for swapping
between tabs, very cool1  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disable outdated plug-ins: Disables plugins if Chrome knows about
security problems with your old version of the plugin. Not only that but
offers to update.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XSS Auditor: Adds protection from Webkit to prevent sites trying to
steal information you have on the other (crazy non-real-world example
would be Yahoo! trying to get Google login info) Replace Google with any
site and Yahoo! with a nefarious one.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instant&lt;/strong&gt;: Like Google instant web search like I do? You&amp;rsquo;ll love this
that loads webpages as you type. Example is www.google.com, then erase
com and put in ie and you never had to press enter once to visit
Google.ie, like magic!

      <title>iPad Evolution?</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2010/10/26/ipad-evolution/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2010 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2010/10/26/ipad-evolution</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since Apple released an iPad there have been various competitors
announced, so it got me thinking what would it take for me to buy one? I
haven&amp;rsquo;t bought the first generation iPad because the lack of a camera on
a device so obviously good for fullscreen video calls has baffled me. I
guess they have to store up some ideas since they need a new hardware
iteration every year, Apple&amp;rsquo;s revenue model depends on that vital
hardware refresh cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4020/4498290240_c16ee8e4b3_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Apple iPad. Photo Courtesy: Yutaka
Tsutano&quot; /&gt;
I think the huge leaps the iPod has made in the 9 years of it&amp;rsquo;s
existence is an Indicator of the iPad&amp;rsquo;s future more than the iPhone is.
Which sounds confusing because the iPhone/iPad are such close relatives
in software and hardware terms. The iPod when released had laughably
small (even for 2001) memory and a FireWire port (not common then) to
being one of the biggest consumer success&amp;rsquo; of all time. It started off
with low memory, buttons to press, black and white screen to iPod
Colour/Photo to Nano to iPod Touch born from iPhone. I think the iPad
will be the rising star and technology will be back-ported from it to
iPhone (instead of other way round as has happened to date).   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The form factor is what gives it that advantage. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised
to see 3D movies or a table made out of iPad screens (like Microsoft has
done), and they&amp;rsquo;re just obvious uses. Pico projectors would be ideal for
iPad sized device before being ported to phones. But this is all
obviously future features, down the line eventually. I think the big
surprise will be future software integrations and hardware sensors to do
all sorts of crazy input leading to all new kinds of areas not
immediately obvious, like the iPhone being such a big gaming success,
which no one predicted: fingers are a very clumsy medium but it turns
out a whole new category of game sprung up like Angry Birds or Cut the
Rope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4745626595_f73f04a206_d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iPad Home screen. Photo Courtesy:
3GStore.de&quot; /&gt;
So I see this innovation in the pipeline and I think iPad first gen is
very first gen. Future iPads may be a distant cousin just like original
iPod and iPod touch are. So it&amp;rsquo;s a thing I will hold off on investing in
for a few years because iterations will move so quickly.. your only
paying directly for the later version you really want!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alternative Interpretation of the Prodigy</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2010/10/01/alternative-interpretation-of-prodigy/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2010 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2010/10/01/alternative-interpretation-of-prodigy</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I was listening to some music, thinking about the announcement 
today on Anglo Irish Bank that we have 32% national debt and 
my generation will be expected to pay that. Kind of depressing 
if you ask me, but no one does, ’cause the media has got that 
one all wrapped up. So I asked myself, is their anything new 
we can learn, while I was listening to the &lt;em&gt;Prodigy&lt;/em&gt; classic� &lt;em&gt;Breathe&lt;/em&gt;.
So I came to the realisation there can&amp;rsquo;t be anything added, or can there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Breathe the pressure
Come play my game I&amp;rsquo;ll test ya
Psycho-somatic addict insane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1282/826416301_451f662a54.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Prodigy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a line from the song &lt;em&gt;Breathe&lt;/em&gt;� it fits beautifully with what 
Ireland is experiencing! Breathe the pressure is the financial markets 
bailing down on us – while come play my game is what the Government 
is doing, going back to those markets. &lt;strong&gt;Psycho-somatic addict insane&lt;/strong&gt;� 
is perhaps the most poetic, as it symbolises the irrational nature of 
markets, and how we are like junkies on the delicious debt we can&amp;rsquo;t live 
without (but are insane to go too deep on). If that got you thinking, 
I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with the line from &lt;em&gt;Breathe&lt;/em&gt; that shouls horrify us all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Inhale, inhale, &lt;strong&gt;you&amp;rsquo;re the victim&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Garmin Zumo 660 Motorcycle GPS</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2010/08/04/motorcycle-gps/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2010 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2010/08/04/motorcycle-gps</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been over a week since I received my Garmin Zumo 660 
Motorcycle GPS unit. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a run-down for 
potential buyers on my experience for the first week. Firstly 
I should mention, I&amp;rsquo;ve never owned another Garmin unit, and had 
two mobile GPS&amp;rsquo; units before (one being Nokia N800 with Bluetooth 
external GPS and other Apple iPhone 3G). The reason I bring this up 
is that a lot of the reviews I&amp;rsquo;ve seen written compare it to it&amp;rsquo;s 
predecessor, Zumo 550, which obviously I can&amp;rsquo;t do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41qNSjQzxiL._SL500_AA300_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Zumo 660 SatNav&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maps&quot;&gt;Maps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What good is a GPS without good map quality? Garmin&amp;rsquo;s maps are 
by Navteq, and generally are of a good standard here in Ireland. 
The only roads it has presented trouble with are roads that have 
opened in the last 6 months, which I guess were too soon to be 
compiled in to the quarterly updates they provide (of which one 
should be free when you register). Lane assist comes with the unit, 
and although only works for me with high profile and busy junctions, 
it is well worth the inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;custom-maps&quot;&gt;Custom Maps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garmin allow a cool feature called custom maps, which means you can 
overlay images, giving the edge GPS co-ordinates, so that your map 
can replace a section of theirs. A good example would be replacing 
Dublin Zoo map with all the attractions (Lions, Tigers etc) visible 
on your GPS. Similar to this is a not oft published feature allowing 
you to have supplemental maps, be they Garmin official (I have Australia 
and New Zealand) or from other sources, such as OpenStreetMap (OSM). 
OpenStreetMap is always more up-to-date than any maps Garmin will release, 
but accuracy is always a problem given the wiki nature. Nevertheless OSM can 
include contours in a topographical style, which are the most expensive maps 
to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POI&lt;br /&gt;POI stands for Points Of Interest. They are 
the Hospitals, Restaurants and Fuel stations listed on your unit. While 
Garmin&amp;rsquo;s included list is good and somewhat comprehensive, OpenStreetMap 
ones were good to have. Most of the OSM ones end up in the wrong format 
and look slightly odd, but are fairly accurate. You can only have one 
set of custom Points of Interest, so it&amp;rsquo;s worth bearing that in mind 
if you need more (combine them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-the-unit&quot;&gt;Setting up the unit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set-up is extremely straight forward and doesn&amp;rsquo;t require more skill 
than hanging a picture really. You get a RAM mount, which you can 
choose to either use the U bracket or the clutch handle mount, fitting 
almost all motorcycles. I had to use the clutch mount on my motorcycle, 
I simply didn&amp;rsquo;t have the bar space to mount the unit anywhere else. The 
RAM Mount plate screws into the Garmin mount, and the ram mount is held 
on to the base by a dual ball and socket joint, allowing maneuverability 
on the GPS. There&amp;rsquo;s a thumb screw on the ball joint to stop it moving 
when a comfortable position is found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then wired the units four molded wires (all in one wire until the end run) 
under my tank, with the&lt;br /&gt;positive and negative to their respective terminals 
on the battery. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to fiddle around with my ignition, so I 
just wired it direct (Garmin says it draws less than 1/2 milliamp 
with no unit in place), which after a week doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have 
affected my battery. Their is a fuse on the positive side, so that 
is a welcome addition. The other two wires are 3.5mm female jacks 
for connection to a pre-existing motorcycle entertainment unit, or 
for using directly. I;ve used the 3.5mm jack directly for headphones, 
and found they worked well (although bog standard headphones in helmets 
can be sore and you have to make sure to &amp;lsquo;detach&amp;rsquo; yourself getting off). 
For those reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at purchasing a Scala G4 Powerset 
Bluetooth headset (which incidentally comes in a bundle with the TomTom 
Competitor: The Rider).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paired my current phone, Apple iPhone 3G without any issues. It will 
load your phonebook on to the device, but does not do this immediately 
(let it stay actively paired for a while), although immediately after 
pairing you can dial any number you like. I&amp;rsquo;ve only dialed using the 
inbuilt mic and speaker on the unit while stationary and the quality 
seemed acceptable, but would definitely be more useful if a headset 
was used. No SMS functionality is available which is an Apple limitation, 
disappointing in my opinion (would like to see SMS&amp;rsquo; pop up onscreen!). 
You can see compatible phones on Gamin&amp;rsquo;s Bluetooth phone list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-computer-software&quot;&gt;Using Computer Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve only used BaseCamp and it&amp;rsquo;s poorer cousin RoadTrip on Apple Mac OS X, 
which is the main mapping and routing software (on Windows it&amp;rsquo;s called MapSource). 
I&amp;rsquo;ll start off with the biggest limitation: crappy maps on your computer. 
The software (probably due to licensing) only comes with a very poor 
&amp;lsquo;basemap&amp;rsquo; which is a bog-standard zoomed out view on the map. If you 
like me wanted to look at your favorite locations, your out of look as 
they&amp;rsquo;ll appear on a blue sea-like background. I &amp;lsquo;fixed&amp;rsquo; this by using an 
OpenStreetMap (which incidentally is a good way to test accuracy for your locale).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also for Windows and Mac is POI Loader, which helps you load any custom 
Points of Interest you may have.m As I mentioned earlier, only one &amp;ldquo;extra&amp;rdquo; 
(in addition to Garmin included ones) set can be loaded on, so if you want 
say custom speed cameras and Open Street Map POI or Geocaching locations, 
you&amp;rsquo;ll have to combine them using other tools first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;geocaching&quot;&gt;Geocaching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geocaching is GPS treasure hunting, for want of a better explanation, or 
see Groundspeak&amp;rsquo;s informative video. GPS units with a good accuracy level 
are needed, as well as good maps. Some of the most popular units used are 
topographical ones, but you can use a road GPS like the Zumo 660. Geocaching 
used to require printing out co-ordinates and clues, and then inputting that 
manually. I found an excellent website/guide to do Paperless Geocaching. 
You need to subscribe to Geocaching.com to get the relevant points around 
you, but you get a lot of information in to the Zumo - like size of the cache, 
logs of people who last found it, the hint, the location blurb and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you never done Geocahcing.com you can join and print caches for free, then 
input co-ordinates in to the Zumo (Where to? Menu &amp;gt; Co-Ordinates) to see 
if you like it. The only major difficulty is the last few meters, as you&amp;rsquo;ll 
want to go to in to pedestrian mode, and then use the compass to get the exact 
spot (which you have to look at co-ordinates for). At this point I grow impatient 
and just use my iPhone to get me the last few meters, but it’s only happened 
once. It definitely saves my iPhone battery since the Zumo is run off the 
vehicle, so no worries there. Also cool is the way you can set a distance before 
loading the points, so if you drive past a Geocache location you can be alerted. 
You can set alert distance lower or higher depending on your will (it could get 
annoying in a big city with a large radius!!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;logs-and-favorites&quot;&gt;Logs and Favorites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it easy to add my custom locations, such as family, friends etc. It can 
be done through the unit or done through the software on a computer. The computer 
version for some unknown reason won’t use addressing information on the unit, 
so finding the address you need, if present, is best done on the unit. Other 
than that for rural Irish locations, I used Google Maps in Satellite/Map view 
and used the latitude and longitude lab extensions to right click on a place and 
get co-ordinates. I then copy and pasted these in to the Garmin software as a 
custom waypoint (warning: they both use different format for co-ordinates, so 
be careful and double check location after).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SoAQGXRUL._AA300_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Zumo 660 SatNav&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logs are a cool way to check your mileage, average speed, etc. Logs are 
automatically kept each time you select a location to travel to. For those 
of you out there like me, who like graphs, even probably meaningless ones, 
there a good (and free) service from Garmin called: Garmin Connect. You can 
see all your route information on a shareable Google Map, and export it to 
Google Earth. Links to this information can be shared on Twitter, Facebook 
etc. I made a trip out to a friend of mine and within minutes of arriving 
home I sent him the details of my route out to him (which was useful as I 
found it hard to explain all the turns I took getting there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overall-conclusion&quot;&gt;Overall conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well made unit, with regular firmware updates, it&amp;rsquo;s hard not to recommend 
the Garmin Zumo 660 if you can afford the steep price a fully waterproof, 
ruggedized car and motorcycle unit comes in at (about &amp;euro; 550/$750). I got 
mine because I plan to use it for both uses, as well as Geocaching, 
monitoring mileage and routes to save fuel, etc. The mount for me is solid 
when the unit is held (and my unit is exposed, not behind my screen, so it 
gets the wind) but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to know sometimes whether the unit &amp;ldquo;clicked&amp;rdquo; 
properly in to the mount. That&amp;rsquo;s obviously a concern since you don&amp;rsquo;t want 
to drop the unit at speed. It has also frozen and shutdown twice, but 
that&amp;rsquo;s been resolved by a firmware update and hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like Garmin&amp;rsquo;s interface better than almost any other GPS maker 
(bar Google Maps navigation, which is not as comprehensive yet, and 
only on phones), so ease of use is good in my opinion (esp. with gloves). 
A telling endorsement is the fact BMW and Harley-Davidson embed these 
units with new motorcycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a solid unit for the small market of Motorcycle ready GPS units, 
a must buy for bikers who intend to travel and can justify the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow&amp;hellip; what a weird feeling, I have a degree under my belt. Three 
years, many friends and a lot of hard work later! The degree itself 
was based on my father&amp;rsquo;s business Grogan Burner Services, and trying 
to solve a real world problem of using Excel spreadsheets. We used 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.python.org&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/appengine/&quot;&gt;Google App Engine&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of Javascript to create a 
modern, sleek &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management&quot;&gt;Customer Relationship Management&lt;/a&gt; system. All the 
code is open source, under &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html&quot;&gt;GPLv3&lt;/a&gt;. Our thesis, including code is 
available below for those interested. We got top honours for the 
submission in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itb.ie/&quot;&gt;ITB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIMsys Thesis - Available soon&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Haiku: Open Source BeOS clone</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2010/06/06/haiku-open-source-beos-clone/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2010 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2010/06/06/haiku-open-source-beos-clone</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I usually listen
to podcasts on the excellent Twit.tv network and it goes without saying
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twit.tv/floss&quot;&gt;Floss Weekly&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favourites. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twit.tv/floss120&quot;&gt;A
recent episode&lt;/a&gt; covered
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haiku-os.org/&quot;&gt;Haiku&lt;/a&gt; - an open source operating system
based on the design of the old BeOS. What&amp;rsquo;s very interesting about
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS&quot;&gt;BeOS&lt;/a&gt; is the design, an integrated
all in one operating system - and the fact Apple almost purchased it.
That&amp;rsquo;s amazing to me, literally in one fell swoop, if Apple had of
offered the 200 million Be Systems wanted, there would be no NextStep
into Apple and by extension - Steve Jobs. It&amp;rsquo;s especially poignant since
Apple just surpassed Microsoft to become the second most valuable
American company.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most spiritually similar of todays operating systems would be Mac OS
X, as it brings the integration BeOS was after. I&amp;rsquo;ve only played with
Haiku in a virtual machine, but already I am impressed. It&amp;rsquo;s a well
designed system, not as buggy as I expected - it&amp;rsquo;s only on alpha2 after
years of development. There&amp;rsquo;s already a lot of applications, all native
and therein lies the fault. The Web browser (not surprisingly) is the
buggiest of all the applications I tried. Most apps are small one
purpose apps, not hard to see a unixy philosophy. One of the developer&amp;rsquo;s
mentioned a port of QT, which could bring QT based apps such as Skype,
KDE apps.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apps or Web?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I think the biggest use of Haiku could be on net-books, it performed
extremely well in limited virtual machine - so it&amp;rsquo;s a pity there&amp;rsquo;s no
commercial sponsor to push it out. The developers mentioned a port of
Java or GTK is not on the radar, so you can kiss good-bye to any Gnome
or Java apps (Firefox, Chrome, OpenOffice.org), but they mentioned they
will target web apps. This seems very curious without a major web
browser, as anyone knows the web should be standards based but how often
have we seen &amp;ldquo;Supports Chrome 3+ Firefox 3+ Safari 4+ IE7+&amp;rdquo; so if this
is the agreed upon approach - they really need a major browser. As a
computer science person, the design of the system interests me the most,
vs others, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t dug too deep yet, when I do, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sure to
post.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I haven&amp;rsquo;t dug in to this either, but anecdotally a good guess would be
hardware support would be poor. The main hurdle and the majority of code
in Linux is purely based on the millions of hardware combinations
PC-based (X86) have to use. This is why for any traction for Haiku, I
think hardware support needs to be OEM based, possibly like the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product&quot;&gt;white-label&lt;/a&gt; EEE PC
netbooks.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like trying different operating systems, have a copy of
VirtualBox or VMWare (and by extension a decently fast computer) give
Haiku a try!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written &lt;a href=&quot;/2008/12/firefox-and-opera-lead-web-video-way.html&quot;&gt;about my desire for open web video before&lt;/a&gt;, 
and now it looks as if it&amp;rsquo;s finally going to happen. Lead by Google&amp;rsquo;s 
acquisition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.on2.com/&quot;&gt;On2 technologies&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP8&quot;&gt;VP8&lt;/a&gt; codec has been 
renamed as &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webmproject.org/&quot;&gt;WebM&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; and open sourced. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorbis&quot;&gt;Vorbis&lt;/a&gt; will be the audio. 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroska&quot;&gt;Matroska&lt;/a&gt; the container for the new format. An Open Source developer 
for x264 does a &lt;a href=&quot;http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=377&quot;&gt;great teardown of the format vs. h.264 here&lt;/a&gt;.
The patent minefield stateside is still not clear by any means, but with 
a strong backer like Google, it&amp;rsquo;s probably the best protection your going 
to get. Announcements, including links to nightlies, dev and beta channel

      <title>Honda Bros Motorcycle</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2010/05/24/honda-bros-motorcycle/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2010 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2010/05/24/honda-bros-motorcycle</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased -
known as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=O_YDAAAAMBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PT23&quot;&gt;cult
motorbike&lt;/a&gt; - a
Honda BROS (known in the US as a HawkGT). It is a 400cc V-Twin 1991
model, with 33BHP / 24.6Kw out of the factory. That put&amp;rsquo;s it under the
legal limit for a learner motorcycle in the A category of license in
Ireland. I&amp;rsquo;ve been progressing through bikes, slowly gaining confidence
and experience. I posted about my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dueyfinster.com/2008/09/yamaha-yq-aerox-best-moped-ever.html&quot;&gt;Yamaha
YQ50&lt;/a&gt;,
My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dueyfinster.com/2009/12/yamaha-majesty-400c-review.html&quot;&gt;Yamaha YP125
(Majesty)&lt;/a&gt;
and now it&amp;rsquo;s a Honda BROS&amp;rsquo; turn!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3657/5717976681_857e637784.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Honda Bros (Photo credit: dueyfinster)&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2010/05/bros1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Honda Bros&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just also ordered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haynes.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;productId=13493&amp;amp;langId=-1&quot;&gt;Haynes
Manual&lt;/a&gt;
for the motorcycle and joined &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hawkgtforum.com/&quot;&gt;HawkGT
forums&lt;/a&gt;, so I am going to learn a thing or
two about maintenance and upkeep of it. Already looking at parts on
eBay, the choice is huge, and pretty reasonable in price. Things most
people replace easily are the handlebars, foot pegs, indicators and so
on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiences on it&lt;/strong&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s a comfortable motorcycle to sit on, but for someone used to a
scooter design, where every limb is free bar right hand, it is tricky to
start off with. Clutch control and gearing was totally new to me - so it
took a bit of getting used too. Slowing down, starting up and switching
gears smoothly are rough starting out, but in a few hours I&amp;rsquo;ve got
basics down. It&amp;rsquo;s all road experience now - road holding, good control
of the motorcycle, looking out for danger and indicating properly and
well in advance.I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of the Road Safety Authority in Ireland (a
lot of their wacky suggestions if made law would put under 25&amp;rsquo;s off the
road) but their goal of reducing road deaths is one being a motorcyclist
I definitely support - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Road%20Safety/Leaflets/Leaf_booklets/This_is_your_bike.pdf&quot;&gt;they make a great leaflet on motorcycle safety
(PDF)&lt;/a&gt;,
worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handling&lt;/strong&gt;
Handling seems like it should be quite bad, I mean with the Majesty I
wasn&amp;rsquo;t used to seeing so much of the road!! But it is in fact measurably
better than the scooter. I think it&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s heavier and has
better tyres for the frame than a scooter could ever have. The Majesty,
typical of most scooters, has the engine on the back wheel, whereas the
Bros, as can be seen in the pictures, has a lot of weight in the centre,
towards the front. One video review on Youtube says&amp;rsquo; BROS&amp;rsquo; love
backroads, it does in fact seem to love nice swishy corners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2343/5718550212_fff1d6873d.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Honda Bros (Photo credit: dueyfinster)&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2010/05/bros2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Honda Bros&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Being a naked bike, I felt naked on it a first, like there was very
little protection from a fall. This can be good and bad. Good in that it
reminds you that your close to the road, so don&amp;rsquo;t do anything stupid.
Bad in that there is no protection from Wind, an element I consider
worse than rain for safety, only beaten by ice. Does it make you a
better driver? Probably so, you are not as insulated as you (thought)
were on the Scooter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purchase decision&lt;/strong&gt;
For me when purchasing it came down to a Honda Bros or a Honda CB250, I
choose the Bros primarily because it look&amp;rsquo;s so much better on the eye.
It has a bigger engine (thinking to keep long term after the test), has
plenty of after-market parts (the CB250 can claim this also) and the
engine has an impeccable reliability - one Bros I saw had 250,000 miles,
yes that&amp;rsquo;s quarter of a million miles on a motorbike engine, and it was
still going!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a 3rd Graphics project we presented as a group for 
Computer Science. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank Mark and James, my team 
members, for all their hard work! The subject of Bauhaus was 
previously discussed in my graphical representation of a 3D 
chess set. The music is courtesy of Jamendo, and is free ;) 
Enjoy it the video!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Donating to Charity</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2010/04/01/donating-to-charity/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2010 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2010/04/01/donating-to-charity</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write this
blog post for a while, probably since 2006. (Almost) everyone that I
know of donates to charity on a regular enough basis. I&amp;rsquo;m a college
student so I don&amp;rsquo;t donate as much as I should. But it really annoys me
how the &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; charities run a campaign of guilt and spend &lt;strong&gt;millions&lt;/strong&gt;
on it. I&amp;rsquo;ve donated money to all of these charities, the third world aid
charities. All of them spend far too much on paying people commission
and advertising. One that I can think of off hand is asking people who
donated more than €250 to sign a form and send it back.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This to me is astonishing, do people ignore letters from the charity
asking for a simple tax refund (a tick box affair). This leads me to a
few scenarios:&lt;br /&gt;
-   The Charity constantly bug people for money by letter - leading to
    people ignoring them
-   People have no emotional and very little other connection to the
    cause - merely donating for self appeasement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect both may be true. The second point reminds me of the Catholic
Churches insistence you pay for salvation before the reformation -
people donate to make themselves feel better. Still this Charity must
see it as money well spent if they predict to make it back.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of the reason I am conducting more due diligence of
Charities I donate to in future. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to subsidise kerb crawlers
or massive TV and Radio campaigns to male me feel guilty - in fact I
switch it off or change channels as soon as I see it coming. These
tactics in my mind are unethical, I want to donate to a charity to help
a cause not make myself feel better. I am not stupid - I know there is
some mental payoff from donating.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also what bugs me is the relationship to churches which some charities
are not honest about - I don&amp;rsquo;t think this applies to Irish Charities
except fringe ones - but definitely applies to some evangelical ones
from the United States. Some have shown an appaling lack of ethics and
moral compass in seeking to convert survivors of the Earthquake. There
preying on people who&amp;rsquo;ve lost whole families in some cases. Can there
conversion not wait until they can rebuild there homes and their
lives?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to focus my future donations in my core area of competence -
computing. I can judge measureable results and hold some of them to
account better if I have the knowledge of the charities core aims and
abilities. Likewise with Open Source software, which can help get
computers in to hands of the poorest and help them educate themselves
for tomorrow and get themselves out of the need for food aid today. Of
course charities closer to home which I have interactions with (having
two rescue dogs) the RSPCA and research into cancer (affected every
family I&amp;rsquo;d guess) heart diesease (ditto).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this post has cleared up my thoughts on two things: making sure
you donate to something you care about and avoid at all costs those who
seek to waste the money you have donated.

      <title>Computer Graphics: Bauhaus Chess Design</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2010/03/17/computer-graphics-bauhaus-chess-design/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Mar 2010 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2010/03/17/computer-graphics-bauhaus-chess-design</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of our projects this semester is to make a Bauhaus Chess
set in a program called 3DS Max (created by Autodesk). 3DS Max is a
modeling and animation tool built specifically for creating 3D
representations and models. Being a lover of Open Source, when we we’re
told although Blender was considered, it fell a bit short for some
reason, so we had to use 3DS Max.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3DS Max is not bad to use, some of the tools are nice if your not an
arty type (like me) and prefer more technical and structured things.
Some of the effects (like glass and water) give a really nice effect to
add to the model your designing. Also as part of the project we had to
have an accompanying website, which you can view at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://bark4mark.com/bauhaus&quot;&gt;bark4mark.com/bauhaus&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some pictures of my chess set:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://neilgrogan.ie/files/2010/03/wpid-PastedGraphic.wmaDpmyzDvuP.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wpid-PastedGraphic.wmaDpmyzDvuP.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your interested, definitely check out the website. If you like my
(pretty average I think) models and have a copy of 3DS Max, you can
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bark4mark.com/bauhaus/maxFiles/NeilSet.max&quot;&gt;Download my .max
file&lt;/a&gt; and play
around with it. All my material is released under CC Attribution Non

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One topic that rarely gets coverage that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen is how
women get along in male dominated environments, such as Computer
Science. For me it has never mattered someone&amp;rsquo;s gender - I love using,
tweaking and learning about computers and if you share that interest -
the more, the better! It has been shown very young children are
conditioned from a very young age by gender rules - shown by Prof.
Robert Winston in Child of Our Time programme. So I&amp;rsquo;ve often wondered in
a very skewed ratio of males to females (as generally there are more
females than males in society) would affect a Woman&amp;rsquo;s choice of even
considering Computer Science, since so few actually do. So I set about
asking our class representative, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lauren Butler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, her thoughts on
Computers, doing Computer Science and being an authority figure in a
male dominated class-room, my questions and her answers follow:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NG&lt;/strong&gt; = Neil Grogan - &lt;strong&gt;LB&lt;/strong&gt; = Lauren Butler - &lt;strong&gt;ED&lt;/strong&gt; = Editor  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NG:&lt;/strong&gt; What first sparked your interest in Computers?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** LB:** Learning computers in Secondary School, seemed like a cool
thing. But obviously I had been playing computer games for years since
the Sega Mega drive came out so in a way I had probably been into
computers and not really realized.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NG:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you remember the first Computer you got?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LB:&lt;/strong&gt; Some Toshiba piece of heavy brick like crap but it had Windows
XP on it yay, the battery charger connection broke and couldn&amp;rsquo;t power it
anymore so now it&amp;rsquo;s dead and good riddance I say.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NG:&lt;/strong&gt; When did you first realise you&amp;rsquo;d like to do Computer Science? In
School? Or after?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LB:&lt;/strong&gt; Secondary School filling out my CAO application because I
couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of anything else. Guidance councilor said to do arts
(typical response to a person that doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do) but I wanted
to be a Garda &lt;em&gt;(ed: a police officer in Ireland)&lt;/em&gt; and computers was my
fall back. Long story short the Gard&amp;rsquo;s didn&amp;rsquo;t want me after the whole
application process so I went to my plan B&amp;hellip;computers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NG:&lt;/strong&gt; Would you describe yourself as a Tomboy? You seem to fit the
description of Heterosociality, ie. Preferring (or at least having to)
have more male friends than female.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LB:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes I&amp;rsquo;m a tomboy, obviously it&amp;rsquo;s kinda of weird for a girl to
like computers and computer games. I do have a lot of guy friends and I
do find them easier to get along with but I have a good amount of girl
friends too.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NG:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you remember you first perception of the female to male ratio
of the class in first year (approx 3:40) ?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LB:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;JESUS I Can&amp;rsquo;t believe I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to be in a class with
all boys&amp;hellip;oh wait there&amp;rsquo;s 4 girls over there&amp;rdquo;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NG:&lt;/strong&gt; Did the fact that Computer Science is male dominated influence
your choice negatively or positively?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LB:&lt;/strong&gt; Neither. but I do get on better with boys than I do girls so In
a way it&amp;rsquo;s kind of better for me to be in a male dominated
environment.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NG:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you feel female lecturers have been tougher or easier on you
that you share gender? (ie. Common experiences)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** LB:** I don&amp;rsquo;t think they have been tougher but I do find they can&amp;rsquo;t
interact with me as well as they do with the males  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NG:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you feel male lecturers have been tougher or easier on you
that you differ in gender?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LB:&lt;/strong&gt; No I don&amp;rsquo;t think they have been either but I may get away with
being a bit ditsy at times  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NG:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you feel the fact the male to female ratio is skewed will
help or hinder your career prospects?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LB:&lt;/strong&gt; No I don&amp;rsquo;t think it will affect it in any way and it should or
at least I hope it will be based on academics.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NG:&lt;/strong&gt; What would it take to encourage more Women to consider Computer
Science? What would you say to sell it to them as a profession?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LB:&lt;/strong&gt; I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know but the fact that you can get into
basically any part of the computer industry by doing this course could
be an incentive.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**NG: **Do you feel any aspect of the course is more male orientated? I
remember one lecturer saying female students excel at coursework, but
this reverses as projects come in later years, which males apparently do
better at?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LB:&lt;/strong&gt; No I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s more male orientated but maybe that
lecturer thinks the more hands on stuff is more male orientated but if
like me who is a tomboy that sort of thing should be more interesting,
i.e fixing computers that&amp;rsquo;s my favorite thing, one of which we don&amp;rsquo;t do
enough of.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NG:&lt;/strong&gt; As Class representative and a leader of the class, do you feel
being a woman has positively impacted the class – i.e. That different
experiences &amp;amp; differing management styles of Women can be a unifying
force?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**LB: **I really don&amp;rsquo;t think I have had any sort of impact on the class,
I&amp;rsquo;m just a very open person and I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that anyone in the
class could come and class to me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**NG: **Do you ever wish people would stop focusing on this male/female
thing and that it all should be a meritocracy? It&amp;rsquo;s it stupid me asking
these questions (have we already moved on?)?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**LB: **I personally don&amp;rsquo;t see it being focused on the male/female
thing. Especially now being in third year where we are being placed in
groups to work on projects, we all use our talents and abilities to
achieve a good grade. Defiantly in my group I work in I have never had a
problem with my gender being focused on, as long as every one pulls
they&amp;rsquo;re weight who really cares about gender.

      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2010/01/04/technology-new-years-resolutions</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some people make new years resolutions about eating healthier,
exercising more etc. I find that boring, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be
healthier? So I am making a list of technology resolutions:&lt;br /&gt;
-   Learn &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;C&lt;/a&gt; in
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/&quot;&gt;XCode&lt;/a&gt; on a
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/getamac/&quot;&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt;
-   Make an awesome
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management&quot;&gt;CRM&lt;/a&gt;
    program for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itb.ie/StudyatITB/bn104.html&quot;&gt;College
    degree&lt;/a&gt;
    (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/appengine/&quot;&gt;Google App
    Engine&lt;/a&gt;)
-   Learn &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; and
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; bindings, using them for
    code
-   Learn to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;, possibly
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://mercurial.selenic.com/&quot;&gt;mercurial&lt;/a&gt;
-   Learn some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C&quot;&gt;Obj-C&lt;/a&gt; with
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/&quot;&gt;Cocoa&lt;/a&gt;
-   Learn some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++&quot;&gt;C++&lt;/a&gt; with
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://qt.nokia.com/products&quot;&gt;Qt&lt;/a&gt;
-   Learn &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/goog_1262610794764&quot;&gt;Python
    +&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/goog_1262610794764&quot;&gt;Tcl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/goog_1262610794764&quot;&gt;/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter&quot;&gt;tk&lt;/a&gt;
-   Learn more about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kerneltrap.org/node/5214&quot;&gt;design of Linux
    kernel&lt;/a&gt; and study some of it&amp;rsquo;s code
-   Do Sysadmin stuff on my server on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linode.com/&quot;&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt;;
    like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/goog_1262610794776&quot;&gt;setting
    up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/goog_1262610794776&quot;&gt;Sendmail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/goog_1262610794776&quot;&gt;,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/goog_1262610794776&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://library.linode.com/&quot;&gt;Servers
    and other stuff&lt;/a&gt;
-   If I have time, investigate &lt;a href=&quot;http://cakephp.org/&quot;&gt;CakePHP&lt;/a&gt;,
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.djangoproject.com/&quot;&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;, maybe
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;on
    Rails&lt;/a&gt;?) and it&amp;rsquo;s ilk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should keep me busy besides college and working! I didn&amp;rsquo;t include
any security stuff, as we&amp;rsquo;re doing best practice for my honours degree
next year. If anyone has any of their own, I&amp;rsquo;d love to see, or any
resources to help me complete my list \^-\^
Happy 2010!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lesson learned: never leave a expensive. Take these pictures I shot 
after the dog attacked my motorcycle! I still love dogs as pets, 
they are man&amp;rsquo;s best friend and just like best friends they can screw up. 
The only thing I am most upset about now is the dog can&amp;rsquo;t pay for the repairs&amp;hellip; 
Forgive and forget Fritzie? Thats a girl&amp;hellip; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. If anyone knows anyone thats in the seat repairing business, let me know! 
I can find almost any other part for my Yamaha YP125 other than a seat, grrrr&lt;/p&gt;

For me it&amp;rsquo;s definitely Kubuntu, but I can see why they choose OpenSuSe.
May I just mention the virtual machine builder system is awesome, pay
attention Mr.Shuttleworth! Although PPA builds come a close second for
useful online tools&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Should I Care What Color the Bikeshed Is?</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/12/07/why-should-i-care-what-color-bikeshed/</link>

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/12/07/why-should-i-care-what-color-bikeshed</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The really, really short answer is that you should not. The somewhat
longer answer is that just because you are capable of building a
bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one just
because you do not like the color they plan to paint it. This is a
metaphor indicating that you need not argue about every little feature
just because you know enough to do so. Some people have commented that
the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to
the complexity of the change.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yamaha Majesty 400c Review</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/12/01/yamaha-majesty-400c-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2009 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/12/01/yamaha-majesty-400c-review</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I own a Majesty 125cc
2002. The video below is the updated (and more powerful) model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Some of the) New features:&lt;br /&gt;
-   2x the amount of space
-   Parking break (for hills! Think handbrake if your a car driver)&lt;br /&gt;
-   Liquid-cooled 400cc&lt;br /&gt;
-   ABS brakes
-   Dual Halogen Headlights
-   Larger rear lights
-   Csr-like oversize dials on dash&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks good, good, good. I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked at price, but my last two
bikes are Yamaha and I&amp;rsquo;ve had little trouble with them. I like the
bigger bikes that have loads of built in storage (panniers look a bit
unnatural) and a bike that&amp;rsquo;s confident in itself to not have to show off
it&amp;rsquo;s braun but rather it&amp;rsquo;s brains with good safety and road handling ;)

      <title>Sony Subsidises Supercomputers for the US Military?</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/11/30/sony-subsidises-supercomputers-for-us/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2009 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/11/30/sony-subsidises-supercomputers-for-us</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ars has a great article about how Sony through the
Playstation 3&amp;rsquo;s awesome power (can&amp;rsquo;t you tell which of this generations
consoles I own?) and subsidy (based on recoup of selling games and
hardware - a model pioneered with the PS1)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; With respect to cell processors, a single 1U server configured with
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; two 3.2GHz cell processors can cost up to $8K while two Sony PS3s
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; cost approximately $600. Though a single 3.2 GHz cell processor can
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; deliver over 200 GFLOPS, whereas the Sony PS3 configuration delivers
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; approximately 150 GFLOPS, the approximately tenfold cost difference
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; per GFLOP makes the Sony PS3 the only viable technology for HPC
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; applications.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Calling the PS3 &amp;ldquo;the only viable technology for HPC applications&amp;rdquo; is
&amp;gt; wildly overstating it, but we get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some really informative stuff on Slashdot regarding nuclear power:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/~david.given&quot;&gt;david.given (6740)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 France generates pretty much all of its electricity from nuclear,
with reprocessing, using pressurised water reactors. Not only do they
have a number of handy engineering benefits such as isolating the
water loop through the reactor from the water loop through the
turbines, but they also have a particularly useful safety feature in
that they&amp;rsquo;re self-regulating &amp;mdash; temperature goes up, power output
goes down. France has an excellent safety record; I can find only one
major incident, which was a coolant spill in 2008.
They even do their own waste reprocessing into plutonium, which is
then reused to generate more power. Unaccountably, terrorists don&amp;rsquo;t
seem to have stolen any of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the opposite &amp;ldquo;self-regulating &amp;mdash; temperature goes up, power
output goes down&amp;rdquo; in Chernobyl. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to forgive me as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t
born then. It was re-iterated differently also:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/~Burning1&quot;&gt;Burning1 (204959)&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; More specifically, modern safe reactors have a negative void
&amp;gt; coefficient. As water vaporizes in an critically hot reactor, it
&amp;gt; reduces the rate of reaction. The hotter the reactor gets, the larger
&amp;gt; the void(s) in the coolant, the less reaction occurs.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Chernobyl had a positive void coefficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main article was about running Nuclear plants over capicity (120%
quoted) and putting contracts up for renewal when possible some plants
should be end-of-lifed (EOL). Another submitter had an interesting point
on the extended life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/~jpmorgan&quot;&gt;jpmorgan (517966)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 The plants were built to a certain design that had large safety
margins&amp;hellip; not because they were needed per se, but because the
designers couldn&amp;rsquo;t prove they weren&amp;rsquo;t. Today, we can model all the
behavior of the plants to a high degree, so we don&amp;rsquo;t need the same
safety margins to keep these plants safe. You don&amp;rsquo;t need a cooling
system with 50% excess design capacity, since we can prove that 25% is
sufficient. We know now that the containment wall is twice as big as
it needs to be, for the original design load. So, we can use the
safety margins to run the plants longer and to higher capacity than
the original design.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chernobyl obviously is used in spades in either side of the argument.
Those who favour Nuclear power point out that it can never happen again.
Those who are against it use it as an example of what has happend with
us mere mortals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/~Burning1&quot;&gt;Burning1 (204959)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; The Chernobyl reactor disaster happened because the operators
&amp;gt; decided to run a test, and turned off the automatic safety
&amp;gt; shut-down.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and because the reactor was of such a design that it could not have
a proper containment vessel, and because the control rods had a major
flaw in that initiating an emergency shutdown (SCRAM) would cause the
reaction rate to INCREASE momentarily, and because the reactor had a
positive void coefficient (will tend to increase the rate of reaction
as the coolant vaporizes, without outside intervention), AND because
there was insufficient instrumentation and operator training to
identify the critical reactor condition until after the meltdown had
started.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There was a perfect storm of design flaw and poor decision making that
lead to the Chernobyl disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although the nearby town of Pripyat was abandoned after the disaster,
Reactors 1-3 continued operation. Reactor number 2 was damage in a
fire, and shut down in 1991. Reactor 1 was decommissioned in 1996, and
reactor number 3 was shutdown in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Personally, reading heavily into the Chernobyl accident has gone a
long way towards &lt;strong&gt;improving&lt;/strong&gt; my opinion on nuclear power. To see
what it took to cause the most recognizable and most cited disaster,
really puts things into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spossa came out with a good joke we all love:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/~sopssa&quot;&gt;sopssa (1498795)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; I&amp;rsquo;m a supporter of nuclear energy, but don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone dumb too
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; close a nuclear power plant.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; It&amp;rsquo;s good we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://yfrog.com/04nuclearguyj&quot; title=&quot;yfrog.com&quot;&gt;this
&amp;gt; guy&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://yfrog.com&quot;&gt;yfrog.com&lt;/a&gt;] in control of a nuclear power plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I love Slashdot for is the informative links, like the one
below of a &lt;strong&gt;back yard nuclear generator&lt;/strong&gt;!:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/~slewfo0t&quot;&gt;slewfo0t (679988)&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; [](http://www.fullcord.net/ &amp;ldquo;http://www.fullcord.net/&amp;rdquo;)
&amp;gt; Ahh, I see the eco-nuts are in full force with this post&amp;hellip; Putting on
&amp;gt; tin-foil hat&amp;hellip;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Nuclear power - PLEASE put one of these in my back yard!
&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nextenergynews.com/news1/next-energy-news-toshiba-micro-nuclear-12.17b.html&quot; title=&quot;nextenergynews.com&quot;&gt;http://www.nextenergynews.com/news1/next-energy-news-toshiba-micro-nuclear-12.17b.html&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One point we should never forget is that Chernobyl has concentrated the
mind safety-wise:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/~QuantumRiff&quot;&gt;QuantumRiff (120817&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt;  I am a huge fan of Nuclear Power, however, I sometimes wonder if all
&amp;gt; the irrational fear of Nuclear Power was Good for the industry? I
&amp;gt; kinda think all the negative attention and scare tactics and stuff
&amp;gt; made the nuclear industry have to go over and above to continue
&amp;gt; proving, without doubt, that they were safe..   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also well versed points that Coal plants would not meet the
requirements if it was subject to Nuclear safety regulations. The bulk
of the cost of Nuclear is in the safety of the plant and fuel
reprocessing/dumping. Most have pointed out it&amp;rsquo;s quite viable to end up
with very small amounts of lesser grade material with modern
reprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why all these comments? Well I wish we had a debate like this in
Ireland. We are bar none the most reliant on fossil fuels (of which we
produce almost none). Everytime it&amp;rsquo;s brought up in the media, ESB and
people who represent them or are in the industry say (paraphrased)
&amp;ldquo;Thats a matter for the 2030&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo;. If you know it takes at least 20 years
to get us up to speed (importing technology and people from France, UK
etc) then why aren&amp;rsquo;t we having a debate now and a plan of action after 5
years, 2014/5 and beyond? There was an old Nuclear power board in the
80&amp;rsquo;s but it was disbanded on account of the Carnsore point objections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe we have the power to think broader now, like we have on
divorce, civil partnerships and so forth. That stuff could not have been
implemented from what I understand in the 80&amp;rsquo;s either. Times move on and
attitudes change. If we had a debate and the facts, I&amp;rsquo;m sure supporters
of Nuclear energy in Ireland like myself would at least get an educated
debate going - as it&amp;rsquo;s our energy future and money.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I mentioned this to people in
College, and some people said boot times are irrelevant. Still it shows
who can get the best performance out of similar hardware, who has to
load more legacy stuff etc. so it is useful for some metrics:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is a Mac Pro overpriced?</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/11/24/is-mac-pro-overpriced/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2009 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/11/24/is-mac-pro-overpriced</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/5411073/why-its-gotten-straight-stupid-to-buy-a-mac-pro&quot;&gt;Gizmodo seem to think
so&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; The $2,500 Mac Pro, desperately in need of a refresh, gives you a
&amp;gt; 2.66GHz Quad-Core Xeon (essentially an i7), 3GB of RAM (triple
&amp;gt; channel, but seriously?), 640GB hard drive (again, seriously?) and a
&amp;gt; nominal graphics card. Spend $800 more and you&amp;rsquo;ll get a another
&amp;gt; processor and 3GB more RAM.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; The $2200, 27-inch iMac obviously includes a screen, plus you get a
&amp;gt; 2.8GHz Quad-Core (i7), 1TB drive, 4GB of RAM and a nominal graphics
&amp;gt; card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gizmodo does have a good point. Apple does make some models for people
with more money than sense. Who said the don&amp;rsquo;t cater to all markets!?!?

      <title>3G Coverage in Ireland</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/04/20/3g-coverage-in-ireland/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2009 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/04/20/3g-coverage-in-ireland</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently used Twitter to
post about my journey on public transport from Kilkenny to Dublin. For
people outside of Ireland the total Journey distance was about 90
miles.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used only my iPhone on the O2 network and close to 50% of the time it
seemed like I had 3G. This was on a train moving at speed, and YouTube
played very well with little to no stutter. It did drop to Edge the
other half of the time, with about 30% of time I still got speeds web
browsing was acceptable on. So in summary: 80% of the time it was
possible to surf the web.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that Journey I was also on a Dublin Bus, and I had full 3G
coverage which comes as little surprise as Dublin Bus only serves densly
populated Dublin and it&amp;rsquo;s environs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days later I went on a road trip to Athlone, and the coverage on
the M4/M6 was not as good as I&amp;rsquo;d hoped. My theory on why the train was
better is the fact on the routes I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a lot more urban areas are
visited, thus the rollout has been very good to densely populated towns,
but along motorways which are far away from such places: your sadly out
of luck.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hutchinson Whampoa (aka 3 Ireland) have recently got the national
broadband contract to supply rural areas with 3G coverage, so most of
these areas should be covered in the next few years. I should note
wireless broadband is hugely needed for mobiles etc,, but a fiber optic
service is really what the government should be sticking money into!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I am very happy to recommend 3G for mobile usage with small
devices. People with Laptops should explore their options and try find
something else first, like DSL, Cable or fixed point wireless. These can
be slightly more expensive then bargain-basement 3G but worth it. As the
old adage goes: sometimes you get what you pay for&amp;hellip;

      <title>iPhone 3G Review</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/04/09/iphone-3g-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2009 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/04/09/iphone-3g-review</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently got an iPhone 3G and away from
all that Apple mania; I thought I would give an honest review. This is
framed in the mindset of all the past Nokia devices (which I have posted
about here also) which I have owned.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay so where to start? Well I think a good place would be what I could
have bought instead. Strange place for a review; but its good to see
what is out there and what I was looking at beforehand.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nokia XpressMusic 5800&lt;/strong&gt;
Nokia make great phones; I have stuck to the reliability of Symbian on
their earlier phones for quite some time. I love Nokia; they mean
reliability when you need your phone most - always a top feature other
manufacturers never got quite right. Maybe its part inertia on my part -
I can&amp;rsquo;t really say. Long story short is that this was a major
competitor: over the iPhone it has expandability and a lot more hardware
features (like RDS Radio), can play a lot more formats also. Downsides:
Got terrible reviews for poor Symbian integration with touch; that
plectrum looks downright stupid; it is not as sleek as iPhone in form
factor (although it is smaller), screen didn&amp;rsquo;t seem as good to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ac/Nokia-5800-xpressmusic.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ac/Nokia-5800-xpressmusic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTC Magic&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/HTC_magic_cropped.png/200px-HTC_magic_cropped.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/HTC_magic_cropped.png/200px-HTC_magic_cropped.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Follow
up to the HTC Dream or GPhone; this Android device has probably the
coolest developer OS around. Lots of activity is going on around Android
at the moment; so the first phones to land in the UK and Ireland should
be more polished (using next gen Android: CupCake). Their is even rumors
it will be adapted and put on net books: possibly making it the standard
of mobile devices if given enough time. This will only bring more cool
apps in time and reduce Apple&amp;rsquo;s iTunes Store lead. Downsides: Not
available yet; so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t buy it. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t have as much apps yet.
Isn&amp;rsquo;t as polished in the software interface as iPhone. All of these can
be resolved with time however&amp;hellip;  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Palm Pre&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/04/Palmpre.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/04/Palmpre.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I
hold out a lot of hope for this! Also Linux based; it promises a cool,
open Web developer community as all the apps are online. Web apps need a
lot more thought for offline use in my opinion, so I am reserving
judgement on this. The interface seems to rock; and developing for it
looks super easy&amp;hellip; Downsides: not out yet, thus lack of Apps and
pricing info.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some junk WinMob&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/02/Sshot114(v2).png/240px-Sshot114(v2).png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/02/Sshot114(v2).png/240px-Sshot114(v2).png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Says
it all really: a smart-phone but for less than a good plain old
non-smartphone. Always made by some obscure Taiwanese outfit - not that
is a bad thing; after-all most iPhone parts come from there. For those
on a budget this was my last option; but darn cheap; just over €115 for
one! I could have bought one for every member of my immediate family for
the price of one iPhone: makes you think, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to the review of the iPhone:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beautiful Interface:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It looks amazing: lets be honest. I have never seen a phone look quite
this good.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fingers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/IPhone_EDGE_and_3G.png/636px-IPhone_EDGE_and_3G.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/IPhone_EDGE_and_3G.png/636px-IPhone_EDGE_and_3G.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Using
only your hands is great; lets face it: you cannot forget your hands.
You can forget a stylus and even the iPhone itself; but those hands are
sticking with ye!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Time: **&lt;br /&gt;
I use my phone for time; Apple has it displayed elegantly, in the same
place, almost in all the phones&amp;rsquo; screens. I love this as I can keep
myself aware of what I have to do next&amp;hellip; All in glorious 24hr goodness,
they way time was meant to be displayed&amp;hellip;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of apps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The App store grows bigger every day and all those little useful Apps
are really handy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Quick Interface: **&lt;br /&gt;
The software interface is very fast at getting you to where you want to
go; to that Twitter application or your Web mail etc.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maps and Location based services:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have seen the future: and it is the Internet that is location aware.
iPhone has taken the first tentative steps in this area with allowing
apps to use location; as well as building it into the camera and maps
applications.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great iPod:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Apple doesn&amp;rsquo;t lie on this one. It is a great iPod. The best? I haven&amp;rsquo;t
decided yet&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s not far off&amp;hellip;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safari:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/67/Wikipedia_Main_Page_on_iPhone.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/67/Wikipedia_Main_Page_on_iPhone.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It
is the real web you get on an iPhone. Not only that: it is surprisingly
comfortable to navigate with. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen a mobile phone device come
this close before. The N810 has a great browser with flash; but all
round Safari wins on ease of use. I heard the earlier versions were very
buggy; maybe I got in just as Safari matured properly.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerometer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Changing the view of applications as you rotate the phone was a
masterstroke. Some things just need to be viewed vertically; others
horizontally. The iPhone just makes it happen: seamlessly.. no buttons
and no fuss. Thumbs up!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SO-SO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not a lot to complain or praise about the camera. It does it&amp;rsquo;s job&amp;hellip;
Their is no flash or other trickery other phones have to offer; so any
sub-optimal light and the iPhone may as well just not have a camera&amp;hellip;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/IPhonehomescreen.PNG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/IPhonehomescreen.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Its darned expensive! I bought it contract-free and to say it burned a
hole in pocket is an understatement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Inbox:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nokia has this one on the button. I don&amp;rsquo;t care whether its SMS, MMS,
E-Mail or a message through telekinesis: put it in one place please&amp;hellip;
It&amp;rsquo;s easier to check; and logically it makes more sense to not have to
visit ten apps for each. Bonus points for allowing developers to hook in
things like Twitter..   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smudgy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It smudges and scratches like nothing I have seen. They tried to make it
too shiny; at the cost of usability. I would prefer a grippier, less
pretty surface: but I am sure I am in a minority on this. I could
probably have even been overheard muttering &amp;ldquo;Smudgy piece of ****&amp;rdquo; .
Add to any price the cost of a cover&amp;hellip;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Keyboard: **&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/IPhone_keyboard_unblured.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/IPhone_keyboard_unblured.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Yes
I know how ugly hardware keyboards look: but they do work. The on-screen
keyboard to me: sucks. I much prefer the N810&amp;rsquo;s on-screen one that I can
use with my thumbs. Using my index fingers just doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel right; and
more to the point: all onscreen keyboards are crap. This is a major TODO
for any willing iPhone competitor&amp;hellip;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background Apps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This may sound like a minor niggle: it&amp;rsquo;s not. Only apps you can run in
the background is the phone, iPod, Safari and Mail. I don&amp;rsquo;t even think
Safari and Mail are true background apps; in fact I know they aren&amp;rsquo;t:
they suspend when they are not at the forefront.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
iPhone OS 3.0 is set to fix notifications; apps will be able to display
a number next to their icon. I personally don&amp;rsquo;t think that is good
enough. Is a notification area as seen on other phones (you know for
like calendar?) too much to ask? I would prefer that as the idle screen
rather than the pretty picture.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I already feel Apple doesn&amp;rsquo;t trust me; but to force me to run around
trying to find a computer with iTunes to activate the thing (I wasn&amp;rsquo;t
near home) is just pure stupid. Do it over the air (for free; at your
expense) or just don&amp;rsquo;t bother. Fail on this, major fail.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rat race jailbreak:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Apple should just give up.. People are going to crack these no matter
what. You only inconvenience your customers (hint: not the networks; us
little people) with all this DRM nonsense. EA has it right: do the
minimal DRM for contract purposes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/IPhone_Image_Viewer.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/IPhone_Image_Viewer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay to release even a free app:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Its a shame Apple thought 30% markup wasn&amp;rsquo;t steep enough&amp;hellip; But even
developer of free applications have to pay $99 to release it on the
store. It would be fine if you could get the app another way&amp;hellip; This
just causes more junk apps to appear at a cost&amp;hellip; If they did this on OS
X it would be suicide; why not open up the iPhone to free software?&lt;br /&gt;
**&lt;br /&gt;
**&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;No 3.5G:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I expect this was due to power; which is totally forgivable and
understandable. But a nice feature would be 3.5G for extra speed; I
expect this and 4G (WiMax?) will appear in later models..

      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/03/26/eircom-responds</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear,&lt;br /&gt;
[My Name]  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;eircom has not agreed to block any Internet sites from being accessed
by&lt;br /&gt;
end-users. As part of the settlement of the above proceedings, it
was&lt;br /&gt;
agreed that eircom would not oppose an application by the Plaintiffs
to&lt;br /&gt;
seek to have eircom block access to the Pirate Bay website. The
Music&lt;br /&gt;
Industry will still have to establish, in the normal way that there
is&lt;br /&gt;
an appropriate basis for the relief which they seek from the Court.&lt;br /&gt;
eircom is not supporting or consenting to the application. The&lt;br /&gt;
settlement makes no provision for any site other than the Pirate Bay&lt;br /&gt;
website.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is important to note that:  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;eircom will not monitor its customer&amp;rsquo;s activities at any stage.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;eircom will not implement any form of monitoring equipment or
software on its network.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;eircom will not provide personal details or any information
relating to its customers to any third party, including the record
companies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;No personal data will be transferred from eircom to the&lt;br /&gt;
record companies which would enable any customer of eircom to be&lt;br /&gt;
identified. eircom has agreed to keep confidential and will not&lt;br /&gt;
disclose any information concerning its customers to the record&lt;br /&gt;
companies and it will in particular observe in all respects the laws
on&lt;br /&gt;
data protection.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With Thanks&lt;br /&gt;
Thomas Ryan&lt;br /&gt;
Head of eircom Customer Care&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>This post is censored by IRMA</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/03/07/this-post-is-censored-by-irma/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2009 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/03/07/this-post-is-censored-by-irma</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I always hoped for
better for Ireland; but it seems the thieving hand of &amp;ldquo;rights&amp;rdquo;
organizations which pretend to represent the artist have struck gold.
Being able to cajole and bribe the largest Irish Internet Service
Provider (ISP) - Eircom; has worked only too well. Although Eircom has
said it will only obey by having a court order - it has agreed never to
oppose these - which makes it complicit in the act of censorship. My
Letter to Our ISP, Eircom, IRMA, EFF:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear [OUR ISP],  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We are a loyal customer of yours. We are writing this because we&amp;rsquo;re
concerned about recent news regarding IRMA (Irish Music Rights Ass.)
relationship with your company (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.blacknight.com/images/irmaletter.pdf&quot;&gt;the recent letters sent
out&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It would seem that they are seeking to become self-appointed censors
of Irish Internet communications. We do not think that a third-party
company should be permitted to arbitrarily decide which Internet sites
Eircom users; or more importantly any Irish Internet user should be
allowed to visit. Will IRMA want to block sites that merely link to
copyrightable material, proxy sites that circumvent the block, blogs
that criticize its actions? This is a very slippery slope and should
be nipped in the bud.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the recent high profile case against The Pirate Bay in Sweden;
IRMA&amp;rsquo;s handlers (IFPI, RIAA) have shown their hand: they don&amp;rsquo;t even
understand the underlying technology. John Kennedy, CEO. IFPI:  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kennedy said he qualified as a lawyer since the 70’s but hasn’t
practiced recently. He was asked if he understood BitTorrent.
Kennedy said he did, but in “very vague terms.” When the defense
lawyers asked more detailed questions, about uTorrent for instance,
Kennedy said he’d heard of it but had no idea of the details. It was
very clear he knew nothing about any remotely technical issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is the the kind of people who wish to regulate the Internet.
Questions need to be asked that if you follow IRMA&amp;rsquo;s requested actions
does this open you up to legal action for any other kinds of material
which rights holders are protective of (Church of Scientology) ? and
can you retain common carrier status like An Post; and need warrants
issued instead of some rights organisation sending you a vague letter
pretending to represent XY&amp;amp;Z ?&lt;br /&gt;
We understand the &amp;lsquo;concern&amp;rsquo; about Internet piracy. Artists definitely
need to be paid for their hard work. It is an important issue in this
day and age, and it must be addressed correctly. Censorship is not the
answer. It is avoiding the issue. As has always happened in these
cases, it is normal customers who are inconvenienced and have their
free speech restricted the most. We need solutions that work, not
knee-jerk reactions that are doomed to fail. We recommend you read the
EFF’s whitepaper on a better way forward for online music.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eff.org/wp/better-way-forward-voluntary-collective-licensing-music-file-sharing&quot;&gt;http://www.eff.org/wp/better-way-forward-voluntary-collective-licensing-music-file-sharing&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are opportunities here that are being missed. I think it would
be for the benefit of both artists and music fans if a solution could
be found that combines the technologies developed by the pirates with
a fair system for paying artists.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;**There was a very similar case in Italy where ISPs were forced to
block The Pirate Bay’s website after pressure from the music industry
(the result was that Italian traffic to the site increased by 5%) .
The ban was judged illegal in court under European Directive, 2000/31
CE which is also applicable in Ireland. **  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If this ban goes ahead, Eircom and indeed Ireland will have a
tarnished image on the world stage as a place where misguided efforts
to protect revenue supersede freedom of communication. We would also
be strongly considering abandoning our Internet subscription for an
ISP who doesn&amp;rsquo;t cave to these demands, and we imagine many other
business&amp;rsquo; will too.&lt;br /&gt;
Please, make the right choice. The world is watching. Your decision
will have an important impact on the future of the Internet in
Ireland.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Yours faithfully,&lt;br /&gt;
[Footer]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will posting more on this issue as it happens. Stay Tuned! If your
Irish and/or in Ireland: please visit:

      <title>Love letter to IRMA's Solicitor</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/03/07/love-letter-to-irmas-solicitor/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2009 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/03/07/love-letter-to-irmas-solicitor</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This post is a continuation on the previous one. IRMA is the Irish
Music Rights Organisation which represents the big four record companies
and their bottom line: never the artist. They have recently tried to
regulate the Internet and have forced the biggest Irish ISP: Eircom; to
use the three strikes rule and boot people off the Internet&amp;hellip; No Judge,
no Jury, no evidence of a crime.. Just an IP address and a sanction
which you cannot contest.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*
I have sent a poignant email to IRMA&amp;rsquo;s solicitor based on their letter
of attack on the ISP&amp;rsquo;s. If you think any of the language is too harsh by
me; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.blacknight.com/images/irmaletter.pdf&quot;&gt;please have a look at a sample of the threat letter this solicitor
sent out here&lt;/a&gt;. This
is a legal firm who were suing individuals for thousands of euro; which
I would hazard a guess most couldn&amp;rsquo;t pay. So in my eyes this is a form
of legal terrorism; and a joke letter to give this solicitor a heads up
that there are people out there like me who read and know the tactics of
the Irish Music Rights Organisation; and the parent companies like IFPI,
RIAA and the Anit-Piracy Bureau they spring from&amp;hellip;. It is my opinion
that nothing short of punishment (jail time) for frivolous threat
letters should be carried out, plus damages (x10 like they do in their
cases) to individuals and companies wrongly stressed out by this. I will
compile a blog post of all the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) that
IRMA has spread soon; and a rebuttal of why their actions may even
increase piracy. One thing is for sure; my analysis will be a whole lot
cheaper (free) and probably more accurate!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I have taken out names, but the legal firm and the acting
solicitor can be examined in the letter above \^  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear [Solicitor for IRMA&amp;rsquo;s name],  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is my position that you are morally bankrupt through your actions
via IRMA vs. ISP&amp;rsquo;s. If you need independent advice on how this
technology works (I am in Computer Science; but I can explain things
slowly; so who knows?) I would be most delighted to help. Please note
my hourly rate is at least twice yours; but I&amp;rsquo;m worth it!  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing from you in 7 days; lest I contact a credit
agency for non-payment. As this email constitutes services rendered by
me. But I am willing to trade for legal advice on disbarment of a
solicitors firm I know which abuses the law; only because I am a
reasonable person!  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Kindest Regards &amp;amp; Love,&lt;br /&gt;
[My Footer]  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;PS: This is intended as Humour&amp;hellip; only slightly&amp;hellip;(joke!). I will
publish any response you make on the Internet; so keep this in mind;
if you don&amp;rsquo;t wish it so; don&amp;rsquo;t respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rest assured I will publish any response; but I don&amp;rsquo;t expect one&amp;hellip;.

      <title>Linux Desktop Environments?</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/01/26/linux-desktop-environments/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2009 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/01/26/linux-desktop-environments</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What are Desktop Environments? Wikipedia defines it as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In graphical computing, a &lt;strong&gt;desktop environment&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;DE&lt;/strong&gt;) commonly
refers to a style of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface&quot; title=&quot;Graphical user interface&quot;&gt;graphical user
interface&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; A desktop environment typically consists of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_(computing)&quot; title=&quot;Icon (computing)&quot;&gt;icons&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_(computing)&quot; title=&quot;Window (computing)&quot;&gt;windows&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolbar&quot; title=&quot;Toolbar&quot;&gt;toolbars&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(file_systems)&quot; title=&quot;Directory (file systems)&quot;&gt;folders&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_wallpaper&quot; title=&quot;Computer wallpaper&quot;&gt;wallpapers&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_engine&quot; title=&quot;Widget engine&quot;&gt;desktop
widgets&lt;/a&gt;.
(See
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)&quot; title=&quot;WIMP (computing)&quot;&gt;WIMP&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would add a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager&quot;&gt;file manager&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser&quot;&gt;browser&lt;/a&gt; to this list
also! Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the two most popular consumer Operating Systems (in
three variants) and their Desktop Environments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[](http://draft.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=7231752728434532377) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;OS Name&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Widgets&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Window Manager&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;File Manager&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Browser&lt;/strong&gt;
Windows XP
Luna
Stack Window Manager
Windows File Explorer
Internet Explorer 6
Windows Vista
Aero
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Window_Manager&quot; title=&quot;Desktop Window Manager&quot;&gt;Desktop Window
Manager&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Explorer&quot;&gt;Windows File Explorer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer&quot;&gt;Internet Explorer 7&lt;/a&gt;
Mac OS X
Cocoa
Quartz Compositor
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software)&quot;&gt;Finder&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)&quot;&gt;Safari 2.X&lt;/a&gt;
Now take Linux; really a Kernel, but packaged means an Operating System.
Which way you package it makes all the difference! You still use the
same drivers, the boot process is still the same, but when your machine
finishes its boot and launches all that graphics stuff anything can
appear: &lt;strong&gt;anything&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s abstraction to have no real graphics in a
kernel other than that which are drivers to control hardware. This is
very strange to people who think in the Windows way (nb. I used to be
one of these). At the end of Windows XP booting I have never seen
anything but Luna; and most people don&amp;rsquo;t know its called that. So it is
very strange for people my age and slightly older who grew up over DOS
and Windows 3.1/95 line to have this fundamental shift in logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When most people say Linux they &amp;lsquo;never&amp;rsquo; (&lt;em&gt;as Home Desktop user&lt;/em&gt;)
normally mean the Kernel; they mean &amp;lsquo;Gnome&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;KDE&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Fluxbox&amp;rsquo;,
&amp;lsquo;Enlightenment&amp;rsquo; and I could go on! To confuse further; people who say
Linux may mean &amp;lsquo;Ubuntu&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Fedora&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;OpenSuse&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Mandriva&amp;rsquo; which are all
packaged versions of Linux Kernel with a Desktop Environment such as
Gnome or KDE (and GNU Toolkit). So here&amp;rsquo;s the table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desktop Environment&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Widgets&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Window Manager&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;File Manager&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Browser&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnome.org/&quot;&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK+&quot;&gt;GTK2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacity&quot;&gt;Metacity&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus_(file_manager)&quot;&gt;Nautilus&lt;/a&gt;
Firefox/ Ephiphany
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org/&quot;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(toolkit)&quot;&gt;QT&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwin&quot;&gt;KWin&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_(software)&quot;&gt;Dolphin&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konqueror&quot;&gt;Konqueror&lt;/a&gt;
Konqueror
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xfce.org/&quot;&gt;XFCE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK+&quot;&gt;GTK&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xfce.org/projects/xfwm4/&quot;&gt;Window Manager&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunar&quot;&gt;Thunar&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midori_(browser)&quot;&gt;Midori&lt;/a&gt;
### The interesting part&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes there really was a point to all of this rambling! The point is the
you are not bound to any graphical way in Linux:* there is none*. It is
completely your choice what you choose to use. If you go with a
pre-package distribution the choice is made: Ubuntu uses Gnome, Kubuntu
uses KDE, and Xubuntu uses XFCE. The really neat part: all can co-exist
happily on the same machine. I have KDE, Gnome and XFCE all installed
right now. I can open up Konqueror in Gnome; Thunar in KDE and Epiphany
in XFCE. All my KDE programs appear in my Gnome menu and vice-versa;
same with XFCE. This is a strange concept from being able to use say Mac
OS X Finder on Windows: it can&amp;rsquo;t be done! Open source plays nice ;) Now
for the part I like; lovely screenshots to help you on your journey to
choose!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gnome-2.20-screenshot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Gnome-2.20-screenshot.png/120px-Gnome-2.20-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KDE_4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/KDE_4.png/120px-KDE_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Xfce-4.4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Xfce-4.4.png/120px-Xfce-4.4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/Enlightenment_DR17_Screenshot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/09/Enlightenment_DR17_Screenshot.png/120px-Enlightenment_DR17_Screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gnome 2.20&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;KDE 4&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;XFCE&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Enlightenment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB.&lt;/strong&gt; I wrote this post as I noticed some in my Computer Science class
struggled with this concept, in many ways I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand this at
first either&amp;hellip; so I just thought what would normal people think? My
response is this post; with a few screenshots to hopefully brighten
things up! &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_X_Window_System_desktop_environments#Desktop_comparison_information&quot;&gt;Wikipedia has a more in-depth comparison of X11
Linux-compatible Desktop environments
here&lt;/a&gt;
for those interested.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ubuntu in four years</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/01/21/ubuntu-in-four-years/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2009 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/01/21/ubuntu-in-four-years</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year was me celebrating four years of using the best 
operating system out there: &lt;a href=&quot;http://kernel.org/&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and the best distro 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;. Ubuntu was my first foray in to Linux; and I 
haven&amp;rsquo;t left it since; although I have tried all the other 
major distros. I started with the first version of Ubuntu; 
Warthy Warthog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Ubuntu-desktop-2-410-20080706.png/180px-Ubuntu-desktop-2-410-20080706.png&quot; alt=&quot;Warthy Warthog&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warthy had a text only installer and it took me quite a while 
to not only get used to the idea of this strange operating 
system; but the fear of leaving Windows-land where all that 
power usage knowledge would mean nothing. It meant nothing 
in terms of the registry and other superficial stuff; but the 
more I used Ubuntu and Linux the more I liked it. In fact in 
2005 I ditched my XP installation altogether. I noticed there 
wasn&amp;rsquo;t an Irish Ubuntu users group; so I mailed one of the 
few people (around 5 I guess) that were around Mark Shuttleworth 
to set it up and get a website going. It was an ill-advised 
effort since I was too busy with examinations really to take 
it on; so I gave it up soon after. But it is still going today, 
people are still involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hoary&quot;&gt;Hoary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next came Hoary in 2005 and I was blown away how fast improvements 
were made; I still couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe all this could be free&amp;hellip; It 
seemed too good to be true really; I thought if Mark Shuttleworth 
ever left that would finish off Ubuntu and that would be it. While 
that might be still true; other distributions out there do 
tremendous work: Fedora is one I&amp;rsquo;d use if there were no Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/20/Ubuntu-desktop-2-504-20080706.png/180px-Ubuntu-desktop-2-504-20080706.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ubuntu Hoary Hedgehog&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I can say is this: while I was definitely interested in Information 
Technology before (and knew I was heading for a Computer Science 
course); I owe a lot to Linux and Ubuntu for showing me the nitty 
gritty (that I wanted to see) and has helped me immesureably in 
my College life. Of course now that Ubuntu is one of the most 
polished Linux distrobutions out there it helps me when I need to 
get away from the nitty gritty too ;) To end this post it is only 
fitting to see the latest version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Ubuntu.png/180px-Ubuntu.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ubuntu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KDE 4.2 Beta 2</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/01/04/beta-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2009 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2009/01/04/beta-2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I downloaded the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kubuntu.org/&quot;&gt;Kubuntu&lt;/a&gt; packages of
the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org/&quot;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt; 4.2 beta 2. For those of you who
don&amp;rsquo;t know; KDE is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org/&quot;&gt;K Desktop Environment&lt;/a&gt;;
which includes a window manager
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwin&quot;&gt;KWin&lt;/a&gt;), common desktop
applications, its own menu
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://home.kde.org/~binner/kickoff/sneak_preview.html&quot;&gt;Kickoff&lt;/a&gt;),
browser (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.konqueror.org/&quot;&gt;Konqueror&lt;/a&gt;), file manager
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_(software)&quot;&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;) etc.
Basically it is the most popular desktop environment on Linux next to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME&quot;&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://kde.org/announcements/announce_4.2-beta1/desktop_thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
*KDE 4.2 Beta 2 with Kickoff Menu visible  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*
**What is so special about KDE? **&lt;br /&gt;
The philosophy of KDE is the advanced configuration it allows through
its &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI&quot;&gt;Graphical User Interface&lt;/a&gt; (GUI),
this is versus &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnome.org/&quot;&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt; which chooses sane
defaults and leaves configuration in hard to reach places and
out-of-sight. This isn&amp;rsquo;t to say KDE doesn&amp;rsquo;t choose sane defaults; it
does and is very user-friendly. KDE has always been the more
Windows-like of the major desktop environments and this hasn&amp;rsquo;t really
changed in KDE 4.X series. KDE is available in popular distributions of
Linux such as Kubuntu, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mandriva.com/&quot;&gt;Mandriva&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensuse.org/en/&quot;&gt;OpenSuse&lt;/a&gt;. The special part about 4.X
series is that for the first time for any Linux desktop environment; it
is fully cross-platform, easily installs and works on Microsoft Windows
and Apple Mac OS X.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kde.org/announcements/announce_4.2-beta2/panel.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://kde.org/announcements/announce_4.2-beta2/panel_thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;KDE 4.2 Panel; with KOrganizer calendar open&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whats new in 4.2?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stability&lt;/strong&gt;. Ever since KDE started the really beautiful 4.X branch
they have gotten harsh criticism for stability problems. This is not
surprising as KDE 3.5 was the result of years of bugfixing and stability
fixes and was really rock solid stable; in fact I don&amp;rsquo;t remember it
crashing at all in the times I used it; but I have been a Gnome user for
a while. This criticism was deserved; but perhaps premature: KDE always
stated this almost ground-up rewrite of everything major wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to
be pretty and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. I used KDE 4.0 and KDE 4.1 and both crashed
frequently; especially Plasma since it powers almost everything on the
desktop.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Desktop Effects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With this release comes the introduction of desktop effects; if your
graphics card is supported. I think this is a great move since projects
like Compiz required hacked in dectection of KDE or Gnome and I suspect
this was coded in; it really makes sense to have desktop effects in the
core; as it will really help stabilise them as the KDE4.X branch
matures.&lt;br /&gt;
*&lt;br /&gt;
*&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Better Customisation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can now control height and length of the menu bar; as well as add
many more plasma applets to it. The Kmenu replacement Kickoff has
stepped up to the plate in this release and features almost a complete
set of icons for any application (much to my chargrin in earlier release
a lot of ? icons could be seen). Also more customisation and preference
panes of Plasmoids are allowed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kde.org/announcements/announce_4.2-beta2/improved-desktop-grid.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://kde.org/announcements/announce_4.2-beta2/improved-desktop-grid_thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Desktop Effects in KDE 4.2 Beta 2&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kde.org/announcements/announce-4.2-beta2.php&quot;&gt;Full major feature overview is
here.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So whats the final assessment?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When this is released I definately recommend you try it! This is the
first release of the 4.X branch I would be happy to install and support
on my family&amp;rsquo;s desktop. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t often get to access it physically
to fix problems; this is one area I couldn&amp;rsquo;t trust either 4.0 or 4.1 to
behave. It still isn&amp;rsquo;t as feature-completed or as stable as 3.5 series;
but in my opinion it is damn close and approaching fast; get it while
its hot!!  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Firefox and Opera lead the web video way</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/12/09/firefox-and-opera-lead-web-video-way/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2008 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/12/09/firefox-and-opera-lead-web-video-way</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I downloaded &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html&quot;&gt;Firefox 3.1 beta
2&lt;/a&gt; (after trialling
other development snapshots over the last few months) to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg_Theora&quot;&gt;Ogg
Theora&lt;/a&gt; video support is coming
on really well. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opera.com/&quot;&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt;, as well as
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; has committed to including this
royalty-free video codec for web use. This is really good news; &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/a-call-for-video-on-the-web-opera-vid/&quot;&gt;as one
Opera Developer
said:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Something however is still not quite there about web video. The video
&amp;gt; solutions mentioned above are proprietary closed solutions that rely
&amp;gt; on plugins to display in a web page - what we need to make video a
&amp;gt; first-class web citizen is an easy, open solution to integrate video
&amp;gt; into web pages, and native support for video in browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In short, we need a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt; video &amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element in HTML, and we must also
agree on a baseline video format that will be universally supported,
just like the GIF, JPEG and PNG image formats are universally
supported for images. It&amp;rsquo;s important that the video format we choose
can be supported by a wide range of devices and that it&amp;rsquo;s royalty-free
(RF). RF is a well-established principle for W3C standards. The Ogg
Theora format is a promising candidate, which has been chosen by
Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all that basically means that video should be a first class citizen
of the web like images. For too long has it been wrapped up in Flash and
Silverlight. They could still wrap ogg theora and degrade nicely if no
plugin for their format is detected (dependent on Adobe and Microsoft
which is unlikely). Anyhoo enough of all this text; how about some nice
video?!?&lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;My Current Firefox Extensions: A-Z*&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/STFVNbiXnSI/AAAAAAAADbc/5R5fcnC-ZP0/s1600-h/74.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/STFVNbiXnSI/AAAAAAAADbc/5R5fcnC-ZP0/s200/74.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865&quot;&gt;Adblock
Plus&lt;/a&gt;; because ads
are for people that don&amp;rsquo;t know how to avoid them! Not only do they stop
your banwidth from being wasted; they make a ton of websites more
usuable. It takes care of Flash Ads as well as static ones; using a
filter that is constantly updated. So even if some of the webs more
devious and sneaky advertisers try to circumvent it; AdBlock can have a
fix to everyone online within hours. It is definately my favourite
extension! I don&amp;rsquo;t block certain ads like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft (the
ones with decent reputations) as that is how the people behind really
good websites I frequent make a living. But for all the rest trying to
do pop-ups and pop-unders; I am sorry your days are numbered! (Some
people higly recommend
&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/433&quot;&gt;flashblock&lt;/a&gt; but I
haven&amp;rsquo;t had a need to use it with AdBlock Plus yet).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/STFXUVn2yrI/AAAAAAAADbk/oepRKJkjEto/s1600-h/943948800.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/STFXUVn2yrI/AAAAAAAADbk/oepRKJkjEto/s320/943948800.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/743&quot;&gt;CustomizeGoogle&lt;/a&gt;
adds neat tricks to Google services such as always using a secure
connection to Gmail; links to other search engines, page histories,
Favicons to search and streaming results pages. Comes in handy once in a
while; but I don&amp;rsquo;t use it daily.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/STFY84xS6qI/AAAAAAAADbs/IY6CmNknWDw/s1600-h/1226529926.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/STFY84xS6qI/AAAAAAAADbs/IY6CmNknWDw/s320/1226529926.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4645&quot;&gt;FireGPG&lt;/a&gt;
adds the full encryption and signing power of PGP to your Firefox
browser. They have built in buttons for Gmail and right click options to
sign, decrypt, encrypt and much more. A must have for privacy-aware
people out there. Only downside is you need to create a Web of Trust
with the keys you choose to use.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/STFazehJvqI/AAAAAAAADb8/0RisGjBs9Ms/s1600-h/1206748320.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/STFazehJvqI/AAAAAAAADb8/0RisGjBs9Ms/s320/1206748320.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2410&quot;&gt;Foxmarks&lt;/a&gt;:
synchronises your bookmarks, passwords accross any computer with Firefox
installed (they have plans for Internet Explorer and Safari). It is
definately my most used extension; comes in handy almost daily. I use a
lot of different computers; and Foxmarks keeps them all in sync! Only
thing they are missing is extension syncing (while keeping your
preferences); but hopefully that will happen in the future!   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/STFZwyN4iJI/AAAAAAAADb0/s-ak4JWJzz8/s1600-h/logo_153x43.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/STFZwyN4iJI/AAAAAAAADb0/s-ak4JWJzz8/s320/logo_153x43.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://gears.google.com/&quot;&gt;Gears&lt;/a&gt;: enables offline access in Google
Reader and Google Docs. I have been hoping for awhile that they would
extend this to gmail; but no such luck yet. It is mildly useful; but I
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t use it daily.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/STFbT4MEsEI/AAAAAAAADcE/y9w21fgYkXg/s1600-h/1222809990.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/STFbT4MEsEI/AAAAAAAADcE/y9w21fgYkXg/s320/1222809990.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8365&quot;&gt;PingFire&lt;/a&gt;
allows you to use Ping.fm service to send quick status messages to Bebo,
Facebook, Twitter, Jaiku, Blogger, Wordpress.com and 100&amp;rsquo;s more. Really
useful to alert people to what you are up to!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/STFcMkRRJFI/AAAAAAAADcM/qVzFFrSf5Vc/s1600-h/1187524480.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/STFcMkRRJFI/AAAAAAAADcM/qVzFFrSf5Vc/s320/1187524480.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4810&quot;&gt;SpeedDial&lt;/a&gt;:
Opera&amp;rsquo;s innovative approach has been replicated in 100&amp;rsquo;s of Firefox
Add-ons; not least this one. But this is very handy when you have a
handful of websites you visit every day. It has a window with squares
filled with images of the websites which you most frequent. It makes
checking news and your favourites websites a breeze. Customisation
options for the tinkerers among us are quite good also&amp;hellip;.

      <title>Research proves video games lack harm</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a0/Gtalogowhite.svg/200px-Gtalogowhite.svg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a0/Gtalogowhite.svg/200px-Gtalogowhite.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I
am not a big gamer; I primarily love systems and how they work. I do own
a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3&quot;&gt;PS3&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_hardware&quot;&gt;amazing
hardware&lt;/a&gt; I might
add) and I prefer
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter&quot;&gt;FPS&lt;/a&gt; and generally
devious natured video games (like the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(series)&quot;&gt;GTA&lt;/a&gt;
franchise). Does that make me a bad person who wants to kill people? Of
course not; nothing could be further from the truth. But some people
stick their fingers in their ears and shout &amp;ldquo;LA LA LA
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre&quot;&gt;Columbine&lt;/a&gt;
LALALA Terrorists LALALA Violent Video Games!&amp;rdquo;. They say it is
destructive to childrens young precious minds. The &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_The_Children_(politics)&quot;&gt;Think of The
Children&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
argument always disgusted me; its like shouting Fire in a packed room
when their is no danger: it is false, just to garner attention and a
sickening twisted version of the facts. Are violent video games harmful
to kids? &lt;em&gt;Probably&lt;/em&gt;; I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t advocate giving them access since they;
just like movies are &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_European_Game_Information&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;clearly rated for
Adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. *
*  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/41/Codbox.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/41/Codbox.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;What
is so hard to understand about that?&lt;/em&gt; Its is clearly an issue of
parenting and morals whether you allow your child access to such
material. So it is clear the real issue is the lack of proper guidance
by parents; either to not bother enforcing the ratings, block their
children from receiving them as gifts, or monitor to check if they spend
pocket money on such items. They gladly do so for other adult items like
adult content, movies, cigarettes and alcohol; why not video games?
Today&amp;rsquo;s consoles even have ratings built-in (PS3, Wii, Xbox 360) which
are enforceable by a password the parent can set. This makes it a breeze
to block adult games and really hard for the average child (never mind
adult) to circumvent. They could still play it at a friends house of
course; you can&amp;rsquo;t lock your children down, but even so you can actively
limit their exposure to such material. The study points out what others
and I have always known: Video games don&amp;rsquo;t corrupt a mind by themselves,
other factors (mainly social/upbringing) have a much bigger impact
(Highlighting mine for brevity):&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Research at Smith &amp;amp; Jones seems to imply that feelings of anger and
&amp;gt; powerlessness often pre-exist a compulsion to play violent games. In
&amp;gt; some cases these people find each other in the gaming world and form a
&amp;gt; bond based on those feelings of alienation and anger. &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Mr Bakker believes that if there was more &lt;strong&gt;commitment from parents
&amp;gt; and other care givers&lt;/strong&gt; to listen to what their children are saying
&amp;gt; then these issues of isolation and frustration could be dealt with at
&amp;gt; source and bring many young people out of the virtual world and back
&amp;gt; into real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If I continue to call gaming an addiction it takes away the element
of choice these people have,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a complete shift in my
thinking and also a shift in the thinking of my clinic and the way it
treats these people.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;
Mr Bakker sees a time when addiction centres like Smith &amp;amp; Jones could
close down if parents and &lt;strong&gt;adults in the community took more
responsibility for the habits of their children&lt;/strong&gt;.
&amp;ldquo;In most cases of compulsive gaming, it is not addiction and in that
case, &lt;strong&gt;the solution lies elsewhere&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7746471.stm&quot;&gt;Courtesy BBC

      <title>SSH Guide</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/11/17/ssh-guide/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2008 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/11/17/ssh-guide</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;note-this-guide-was-written-for-use-by-my-computer-science-class&quot;&gt;**Note: This Guide was written for use by my Computer Science class&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on Linux (and Mac OS X where noted). I haven&amp;rsquo;t used SSH on Windows; but
hopefully someone can make sure this guide works also on Windows by
noting differences). SSH comes with nearly all Linux distros and all Mac
OS X releases. &lt;br /&gt;
**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OS Specific Colours: Linux - Mac OS X - Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
** &lt;br /&gt;
**&lt;br /&gt;
**&lt;a href=&quot;http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sshwindows/setupssh381-20040709.zip?modtime=1089331200&amp;amp;big_mirror=0&quot;&gt;Download SSH For
Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
**  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows: **&lt;/strong&gt;You need to follow README located in Start &amp;gt; All
Programs &amp;gt; OpenSSH &amp;gt; README to set up password directories and files.
After that is done; just do Start &amp;gt; Run; type cmd and hit enter to get
Windows command line. All commands beginning with SSH should run
unmodified. ****&lt;br /&gt;
**&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default it allows access to your username and password; which is okay
but not totally secure! If you are logging on from a machine which has
the same username as one you are trying to access you can drop
&amp;lsquo;myusername@&amp;rsquo; bit. mylaptop represents the IP address of the machine you
are trying to contact!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$&lt;/strong&gt; ssh myusername@mylaptop   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To forward X server (use the flag -Y on Mac OS X) :&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;$&lt;/strong&gt; ssh -X myusername@mylaptop  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use a different port (where port is WXYZ) also: (use the flag -Y on
Mac OS X):&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;$&lt;/strong&gt; ssh -X myusername@mylaptop -p WXYZ  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-get-it-more-secure-&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get it more secure:&lt;/strong&gt;* *&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generate-your-own-key-this-will-ask-for-a-password-can-be-left&quot;&gt;*Generate your own key (this will ask for a password; can be left&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blank but not recommended):*  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$&lt;/strong&gt; ssh-keygen   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copy your key to machine you want to login to:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;$&lt;/strong&gt; scp \~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub mylaptop:\~/.ssh/authorized_&lt;br /&gt;
keys2&lt;br /&gt;
(This command uses SCP (Secure Copy) to copy your key into a list of
keys allowed on remote machine. You also have an authorized_keys2 on
your computer)
### &lt;em&gt;Edit Configuration File:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally edit configuration to make it more secure (nano is a
lightweight text editor - &lt;strong&gt;this command will be very different on
Windows; since it won&amp;rsquo;t have sudo command, nano editor or the SSH
configuration file in the same place; I currently have no clue what it
would be on Windows&lt;/strong&gt;):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;$&lt;/strong&gt; sudo nano /etc/sshd_config   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Options I recommend changing (hash at the start means it is commented
out; so remove to take effect) :*&lt;br /&gt;
 #Port 22 - change to whatever; recommended between 2000-65000  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enable these three:*&lt;br /&gt;
 #RSAAuthentication yes** **&lt;br /&gt;
 #PubkeyAuthentication yes
#AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set to &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo; and uncomment to allow forwarding of visuals:*&lt;br /&gt;
 #X11Forwarding no  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set to &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo; and uncomment if you want to use your machine as a
proxy:*&lt;br /&gt;
 #AllowTcpForwarding yes&lt;br /&gt;
 #PermitTunnel no
*Now &lt;strong&gt;save the file&lt;/strong&gt; with you changes ( CTRL and X; it will ask to
save; enter Y and enter key). These will not come in to effect until to
stop and start the SSH server! *
&lt;strong&gt;Stop/Start on Linux&lt;/strong&gt;
To stop SSH server, enter:&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;$&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;code&gt; sudo /etc/init.d/ssh stop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To start SSH server, enter:&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;$&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;code&gt; sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To restart ssh server, enter:&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;$&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;code&gt; sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop/Start OS X&lt;/strong&gt;
To stop SSH Server, enter:
&lt;strong&gt;$&lt;/strong&gt; sudo /sbin/service ssh stop
To Start SSH server, enter:
&lt;strong&gt;$&lt;/strong&gt; sudo /sbin/service ssh start
**&lt;br /&gt;
That is it!**&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the options you can skip based on preference. I recommend not
allowing password only login and setting up keys. It is much harder to
break; and there is no &amp;lsquo;known&amp;rsquo; way to break it&amp;hellip;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of Computer
Science you do a couple of general modules which are general in nature
about computing; but I think that just reflects the broad use of IT in
every part of society today. As things go digital or are created
digitally; understanding of this concept is vital; that is where Web
Multimedia comes in. For my first project of this second year; I had to
do a movie made of stills with custom sound effects. Restrictions on
sources of images and sounds (very high percentage had to be self made).
Here it is:&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Gmail Video Chat</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/11/13/gmail-video-chat/</link>

      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/11/13/gmail-video-chat</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_JE4qNpFW6Yk/SRkwSMYD_aI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/gsDJdA4WBgY/s1600/video_chat.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_JE4qNpFW6Yk/SRkwSMYD_aI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/gsDJdA4WBgY/s200/video_chat.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
I am an avid &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.google.com/&quot;&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt; user through Google Apps.
I use the calender, chat, code, sites, pages, docs the whole lot. One of
my friends even jokes &amp;ldquo;You should just work at Google Marketing&amp;rdquo;. Yes I
like most of Google&amp;rsquo;s products; but I am a products guy; I use whats
good, cheap and fast (pick two). Google has the cheap down due to
ad-revenue; for the moment anyways in the current financial turmoil.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was delighted when I seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/say-hello-to-gmail-voice-and-video-chat.html&quot;&gt;Gmail Video and
Voice&lt;/a&gt;
released. I have used it on my computer and I can say thats its really
good: better than
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol&quot;&gt;SIP&lt;/a&gt; video;
better than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skype.com/intl/en/&quot;&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; on the quality front.
Google Talk has always had the clearest voice calling from my usage of
it vs. the others.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family use Gmail; I have converted almost everyone I know to use it.
Most of my Computer Science class have it (some just use the student
hotmail); so I will really use this feature. There are a few problems
however:&lt;br /&gt;
-   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/talk/&quot;&gt;Google Talk&lt;/a&gt; itself has no video; a
    curious decision
-   It is not encrypted like Skype; there should be an option
-   No Linux client: Unbelievable when Mac OS X is supported!
-   Not compatible with Nokia Internet Tablets; an early testbed for
    Google Talk Video
-   Open Standards but not Open Source: patent issues with licensed
    video codecs   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features missing which would really benefit me as a CS student:&lt;br /&gt;
-   Multi-way voice calling
-   Multi-way Video calling
-   Whiteboard function (Integration into GDocs?)&lt;br /&gt;
-   Compatibility with SIP video
-   Scheduling of Video/Voice through resource availibility option in
    Google Calendar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are mainly organisational for group projects etc. which would be
very handy not only to me; but business through apps and Google the
company itself. Get working on it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.ie/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;!

      <title>Innovation Right Here - Dept. of Education is Wrong</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/11/12/innovation-right-here-dept-of-education/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2008 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/11/12/innovation-right-here-dept-of-education</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I usually get both of Ireland&amp;rsquo;s daily national
papers to my email inbox every morning. I think it&amp;rsquo;s very important to
catch up on the latest news; as I think you are more informed and have
conversation pieces to talk to people (for those awkward silences where
&amp;ldquo;Ye the weather is terrible&amp;rdquo; just won&amp;rsquo;t do). So I was highly informed
when I read this piece: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.ie/education/latest-news/dcu-head-hits-out-at-outofdate-okeeffe-1532789.html?from=dailynews&quot;&gt;DCU head hits out at &amp;lsquo;out-of-date&amp;rsquo;
O&amp;rsquo;Keeffe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;There is a tension between the traditional expectation that
&amp;gt; universities will primarily teach students, and the more recent
&amp;gt; requirement for universities to underpin economic development and
&amp;gt; attract corporate research and development into Ireland . . . not to
&amp;gt; mention the role of universities as agencies of cultural regeneration
&amp;gt; and of tackling disadvantage and structural poverty,&amp;rdquo; said Prof von
&amp;gt; Prondzynski.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree more. I think it is disgraceful that students who try
to improve themselves; their standard of living and their community by
getting a great education are penalised with higher fees. The equal
access to education that the state is trying to promote will be further
harmed by an increase in fees. It is [relatively] cheap to go to college
as it is; and still the economic underclass are under-represented.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing is for free don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong&amp;hellip; But these students turn in to
some of the hardest and most innovative workers in the world; and most
get a really good salary to match; which means they pay the most tax on
average of any socio-economic class. People in the super-rich category
can afford to off-shore; not so for these professional people. People in
the lowest socio-economic classes pay the standard rate of 20% as they&amp;rsquo;d
earn under the average industrial wage (about 30,000) and rightly so. So
that just leaves the &amp;lsquo;higher&amp;rsquo; if-you-will middle class (although all
terms are relative; I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with the labels personally); which pay
disproportionate amount. So the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gov.ie/&quot;&gt;Government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gov.ie/&quot;&gt;s&lt;/a&gt; policy seems to
discourage many of these people from actually educating themselves and
getting a good job. This shocking tidbit sums up the government:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;I think he (Batt O&amp;rsquo;Keeffe) has a view of how universities should
&amp;gt; operate which is fairly far removed from what my view would be. For
&amp;gt; example, he raised the issue of whether we do too much research,&amp;rdquo; said
&amp;gt; Prof von Prondzynski (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dcu.ie/&quot;&gt;Dublin City University&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; Head)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too much research? Oh my god; I actually cannot believe I read that.
Maybe I should write to Batt O&amp;rsquo;Keefe and remind him what research gets
you&amp;hellip; Just in the Tech field alone (which I know most about); research
is everything. The Internet? Check, American Military Research
(Arpanet). The Web? Check, CERN Particle Physics Laboratory. Graphical
Interfaces? Check, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Not to
mention the massive contribution by Bell Labs/AT&amp;amp;T to Unix etc. These
are only ones right off the top of my head. All I can say is I hope 3rd
Level (as Colleges are known in Ireland) gets their own government
minister (and department) and is free of this man: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batt_O'Keeffe&quot;&gt;Batt O&amp;rsquo;
Keefe&lt;/a&gt; and his 20th century
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.education.ie/&quot;&gt;Department of Education&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seriously: what an awesome
song. Every Geek should love it! It&amp;rsquo;s got the famous line &amp;ldquo;My heart is
human, my blood is boiling, my brain IBM&amp;rdquo;. If this is not in every Geeks
top ten songs; then I resign! I even listen to it as I type this!
Anyways enough sounding like a DJ who just got his
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payola&quot;&gt;Payola&lt;/a&gt; check off the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America&quot;&gt;RIAA&lt;/a&gt;;
I&amp;rsquo;ll just post the free video so y&amp;rsquo;all can watch&amp;hellip;. :  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barenaked Ladies also do a cover of it interspersed with their own song
(King Of Bedside Manner):&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Hurling - Four in a row?</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/10/19/hurling-four-in-row/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2008 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One cannot help but be amazed at Kilkenny; true masters of the Irish
Gaelic Sport of hurling. I mean as my previous posts mention I have
moved to Kilkenny; and rural South Kilkenny at that. They live and
breath Hurling down here: it&amp;rsquo;s literally a way of life. That is why they
are so good; no mystery here folks: its is literally bred into children
in schools and everyone plays it. More people playing means even though
Kilkenny is only around 100,000 people it still has a large amount of
people to pick from and they get the best training which equals the best
results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The City&amp;rsquo;s mayor Pat Crotty said (paraphrased as I read it and cannot
find the quote): &amp;ldquo;People say Kilkenny winning all the time is bad for
hurling, not with displays like that&amp;rdquo;. That is referring to the utter
decimation of the county that adjoins South Kilkenny: Waterford. They
were beaten by the biggest scoreline in over 50 years I think it was;
yes it was a savage display. I speak as a Kildare man from a county that
has achieved little to no success (sorry lads lets face facts!); and I
wish they would emulate Kilkenny&amp;rsquo;s prowess and agility. The press raved
about how it was the best display of Hurling this century. As things go
I was working; but the vibe was unreal. I was also working when over
25,000 people showed up to greet them home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways in South Kilkenny where my folks live is called Danesfort; and
to prove how into Hurling they are they even have a song (bear in mind
this is not a town or village; its basically a pub, church and houseS
with less than 80 people living here); proof if it&amp;rsquo;s needed Kilkenny are
mental about Hurling:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just read one of the most informative and insightful blog posts of
my entire life. Half serious a guy takes a look back at when he had to
beat up a Girl. Weird stuff!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Yes, you read that right, I had to beat up a girl … not a woman. She
&amp;gt; was asking for it and she deserved it.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Yamaha YQ Aerox - best moped ever?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I
think so! Got one there 2 months ago and forgot to write a blog post
about it. I got a &amp;lsquo;01 model for a bargain price I believe; but this
theory has yet to be tested (I&amp;rsquo;ll wait for a year to be up). As I
mentioned before in previous posts my parent&amp;rsquo;s house is now in a remote
location with no train/buses anywhere nearby. So transport was
essential! At this time also there was a major crack down on learner
drivers not being accompanied by a fully licensed driver (of two years).
So by the time I&amp;rsquo;d saved the money for the car; got 10 lessons and
convinced anyone I knew with over two years full driving experience to
accompany me; even to work - was just to much hassle - hence the moped
which has no such onerous requirements. In fact only one it does really
have is that you can&amp;rsquo;t have passengers - I won&amp;rsquo;t be carrying anyone
anyways - so I am not too bothered. Anyhoo take a look at the photos I
took when I got it. I have done it up since then: new tyres, resprayed
exhaust, full service; new mirrors; repaired exhaust; flushed out
radiator and put in proper coolant just to name a few. So it sounds
allot better and drives better than ever!  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Summer - One Month On.....</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well one month in Summer
2008! Summer has been okay so far; I&amp;rsquo;ve had nothing much to report hence
lack of Tech posts. Sure the iPhone 3G looks good,
Google/Yahoo/Microsoft spats interesting but after a while it become a
bit circular and repetitive.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started working at the UK&amp;rsquo;s leading retailer for
touring/car/bike and accessories; as well as a move to the south east of
Ireland; that much further to the capital: Dublin. It&amp;rsquo;s Ireland&amp;rsquo;s
smallest city and home to Ireland&amp;rsquo;s very first Parliament about 400
years ago: Kilkenny. It&amp;rsquo;s steeped in culture and it&amp;rsquo;s the only city in
Ireland to rival Dublin&amp;rsquo;s culture, nightlife and restaurants and hold
it&amp;rsquo;s own.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying to acquire a moped (aka. Scooter or Italian &amp;lsquo;ped) to have a
run-around to work and back. I am doing it in reverse however as were
still moving to our house in the county of Kilkenny (in the city rentig
at the moment until it&amp;rsquo;s ready!). I&amp;rsquo;ll be getting Scooter first, then
license so in other words it will be arseways! Their is always a backlog
in summertime as students like me clamour to get driving!! Whoops should
have scheduled during the leaving cert (Ireland&amp;rsquo;s answer to
SAT/GCSE)!!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More will follow soon as I complete the move and get the bike; expect a
few picture posts dedicated to the bike!!

      <title>I've decided - I'm decidedly middle class</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/05/14/ive-decided-im-decidedly-middle-class/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2008 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/05/14/ive-decided-im-decidedly-middle-class</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a trip in to the faire capital city of Ireland today:
Dublin. Okay I&amp;rsquo;ll get this out of the way: I had a Frappacino in
Starbucks and I&amp;rsquo;m a student; so not too poor of a student ;)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I saw the inside of Brown Thomas for the first time. I don&amp;rsquo;t shop
for fashion at all: but what I found was the kind of vulgarity and
fake-ness I&amp;rsquo;d expect of London or New York; not Dublin. To paraphrase
Bono: &amp;ldquo;In America if you have your mansion on a hill people look up to
you and think &amp;lsquo;I want to be like him and afford a house like that one
day&amp;rsquo;; if you have the same mansion in Ireland people say &amp;lsquo;look at the
fucken eejit on the hill with that house; thinks he&amp;rsquo;s god or sumthen&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;
and that to me was always an endearing part of Irish culture; people
around you being the great leveller if you thought you were the bomb.
Inside BT (Brown Thomas) was all the names you&amp;rsquo;d expect; all the major
names more at home in Paris, London or New York. I confronted my friend
who was showing me round about my opinions (in my usual polite manner:
just say it). To my surprise he agreed 110%. Yes he said: for the people
who buy this stuff can tell who else is wearing it; and I think he meant
that by this logic movers and shakers also wore all the brands to look
the part. Soon after he told me he was also learning Golf because he
knew it would be a great benefit for his future career: &amp;ldquo;All important
people also play golf&amp;rdquo; he assured me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see this divide in society and I admit it bothers me. Where I go to
College, there is an estate across the road which is by any standards
not had the full benefit of the Celtic Tiger (the Irish Boom Economy). I
get the bus from this place and everytime it bothers me that I see some
social problems: everything from unruly kids trying to ruin the place to
alcholics. But I also have people in my class from that estate: some of
the nicest you&amp;rsquo;d ever care to meet. I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked by them my opinion
on where they live and what do I think other people think.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then comes my home town. It is on the border of Dublin (city) and
Kildare (farmers and horsebreeders) and we&amp;rsquo;ve got a mix of both. But
Leixlip is decidedly middle class; low enough crime; not much social
tension to be heard of; certainly nowhere near the likes of South Dublin
(seen as upper class) or North Dublin (seen as lower class). Which is
why I don&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable in either: maybe middle class is the real
stigmata?

      <title>Will Google Buy Skype?</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/04/09/will-google-buy-skype/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2008 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/04/09/will-google-buy-skype</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been all over the tech
news world lately; apparently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.ie/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is muling
over taking Skype off of Ebay&amp;rsquo;s hands. Ebay has already written down the
value of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype&quot;&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; as a large loss on
their purchase price of $2.6 billion in stock and cash. But
w&lt;a href=&quot;http://about.skype.com/online.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://about.skype.com/online.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;ould
Skype&amp;rsquo;s G-branded future be any better?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it would be. Skype is a strong international brand for voice
calls, instant messaging and video calls; but of course it competes
directly with Google Talk. Skype as a company has made a lot of
mistakes; but they actually produces some of the best technology for p2p
VOIP out there in the marketplace. Skype is particularly strong in
redundancy, cost of network operation (since it&amp;rsquo;s p2p every user
carries&amp;rsquo; each others traffic; most people have no idea of this fact) and
routing around the most draconian network admins out their through their
routers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is a strict propreitary network and is centrally controlled
at the moment for Ebay. All voice is encrypted accross Skype; but it is
well-speculated that Skype has a back door to snoop on anyone it so
wishes (although it would never publicly admit to this). Legislation
hasn&amp;rsquo;t caught up to protect voice calls like they are on &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo;
PSTN [Pretty Simple Telephone Network].  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Google could open up Skype&amp;rsquo;s network; to what extent is anyone&amp;rsquo;s
guess. I hope they integrate XMPP like Gmail Chat capability (which is
an open standard); and do the same for voice/video (could take a while
based on patents) . I predict the client will most likely stay
propreitary and closed-source; as opening it up could reveal back-doors;
patent and copyright issues and more. But overall I think the
transaction could go quite well for both parties&amp;hellip;

      <title>Letter to EU Commissioner on 95 Year Copyright Extension [Updated]</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/02/16/year/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2008 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/02/16/year</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently read a Slashdot article &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/02/14/1626228&quot;&gt;EU Commissioner proposes 95 year
copyright&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. I am a
staunch supporter of the European project; or at least the ideals it is
based on to create a peaceful, demcratic union of countries with a
common background and share similiar goals. Intrigued by the article I
read it only to find out that a local man who used to represent my area
was responsible. I had to write to him to ask how he lost his mind&amp;hellip;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. McCreevy;  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I am writing to you from Kildare. You have served our county over the
years; and I even thought you would become Taoiseach (Prime Minister
of Ireland) one day (being the Minister for Finance is a front-runner
position- let&amp;rsquo;s be honest) but then you went to Europe.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s not the subject of this correspondence. I am writing to you
to voice my disgust for your proposed levies and taxes in conjunction
with an even longer copyright extension. What are you thinking Mr.
McCreevy? The average musician does not live for 95 years. I am
responding to points made by you in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/02/14/business/EU-FIN-EU-Music-Royalties.php&quot;&gt;International Herald
Tribune&lt;/a&gt;
(Original article: AP Newswire; Published 14/02/2008) and the
legislation proposed at your level in the commission (through which
you will have direct influence).  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Your Misguided view of copyright:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;If nothing is done, thousands of European performers who recorded
&amp;gt; in the late 1950s and 1960s will lose all of their airplay royalties
&amp;gt; over the next ten years,&amp;rdquo; said EU Commissioner Charlie McCreevy, the
&amp;gt; union&amp;rsquo;s internal market chief. &amp;ldquo;These royalties are often their sole
&amp;gt; pension.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you Mr. McCreevy; but I will have to set aside
money from my earnings for my pension;. why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t artists?
Copyright is supposed to encourage innovation; not reward old
creations. Copyright on these works should have rightfully expired on
these a long time ago; forcing these musicians to create more music we
all love and enjoy, instead of idly collecting money for work done
sometimes as much as fifty years ago. These Musicians were already
paid for their works a long time ago; and they signed it over to a
[record] company. You are only enriching a company that contributes
zero cultural value back by extending a copyright term. This has been
proven time and time again if you would do your research.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Extra Copies / Levies&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; The EU executive also wants to look again at reforming copyright
&amp;gt; levies charged on blank discs, data storage and music and video
&amp;gt; players to compensate artists and copyright holders for legal
&amp;gt; copying when listeners burn an extra version of an album to play one
&amp;gt; at home and one in the car.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Why should as a consumer I have to pay twice for a music recording?
You know this will only have the effect of driving up the cost of a CD
and increasing piracy? &amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t charge me twice if I choose to
pirate it!&amp;rdquo;; and this is how a lot of consumers will see it; like
double tax evasion only easier with less risk! You must recognise also
that the music collection agencies are run by cartels that is the
music industry (Big Four: SonyBMG, Warner, EMI, Universal ) which is
almost never fair to artists? (Look at SoundExchange in the United
States for this). What about when I use disks for backup of my data
(which is the only reason I use them for) why should I pay royalties
for music I never pirated? How also can you tell which artists
deserves more royalties than the next? You can&amp;rsquo;t; and that is why this
idea is so stupid you should put it to bed now!  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Who it benefits?  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extension would not benefit only stars such as French crooner
Charles Aznavour or British pop star Cliff Richard, McCreevy said.
Session musicians who played on a recording would also be able to
draw on a new fund.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Ah-ha-ha-ha You see Mr. Mc.Creevy case in point! These men actually
own; or have very liberal licensing terms with their record companies;
allowing them in the first place to be spokespeople for longer
copyright terms. The same cannot be said for the vast majority of
artists; who don&amp;rsquo;t have that luxury. Please remind me what exactly
these men have contributed to society musically in the last few years?
Oh riiiiiight; thats nothing; zero; zilch! What about others of that
era? Elvis? dead and buried! Beatles? no longer around! and I could go
on and on and on about how they are literally getting money for
nothing&amp;hellip;.. The only beneficiary will be the record companies who own
the recordings to 70&amp;rsquo;s and 80&amp;rsquo;s material which is lucrative (for this
see Michael Jackson owning some of the Beatles catalogue).  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;My plea to you is to stop this insanity and work towards less
copyright restriction not more. Copyright was originally designed to
safeguard an original author to make back the time and the effort
he/she put into the creation which benefitted society (ie.
compensation usually in the form of monetary gain). With this
understanding it&amp;rsquo;s plain to see these people have long since got back
many times the creative energy they put in and societies debt to them
has long since passed.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;
Your former constituent;&lt;br /&gt;
N Grogan  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;14/02/2008  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;P.S. I am eagerly awaiting you reply and any comments you have on what
I have said&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a reply from someone in the commissioners office (I have removed
the name); better than nothing but I&amp;rsquo;d still like to hear from him on
the matter&amp;hellip;. Anyway here it is:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear Mr Grogan, &lt;br /&gt;
Thank you for your e-mail of 14 February concerning the term of
protection for sound recordings. &lt;br /&gt;
The Commissioner has noted your most interesting comments. These will
be taken into account in the elaboration of the formal Commission
proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Why I think Amarok rocks....</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/02/14/why-i-think-amarock-rocks/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2008 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/02/14/why-i-think-amarock-rocks</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just purchased
an &lt;a href=&quot;http://49100.spreadshirt.net/en/DE/Shop/Article/Index/article/Amarok-Hoodie-Navy-1117657&quot;&gt;Amarok
hoodie&lt;/a&gt;
and&lt;a href=&quot;http://49100.spreadshirt.net/en/DE/Shop/Article/Index/article/Amarok-Classic-Sports-Tee-1094948&quot;&gt;t-shirt&lt;/a&gt;;
and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier supporting one of my favourite open source
projects! What makes it so good? Have you ever heard of Amarok? Chances
are if your an OS X or Windows user; you haven&amp;rsquo;t. All this is about to
change! The amarok team are busy porting it from it&amp;rsquo;s UNIX underpinnings
to Windows and OS X.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amarok.kde.org/features&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Whats to like about Amarok
then?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rokymotion.pwsp.net/promowiki/images/1/18/Amarok_Features-covers.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rokymotion.pwsp.net/promowiki/images/1/18/Amarok_Features-covers.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-   The blazingly cool name: Amarok is an intuit name for a wolf and
    also is cool phonetically: am a rock!
-   Album covers in full glory (see picture right)
-   Full lyrics support; even for the most obscure songs you have laying
    around!
-   Wikipedia integration: truly a gem; you can do what Amarok says
    &amp;ldquo;Rediscover your Music&amp;rdquo; in looking up artist, song or album in the
    free encyclopedia.
-   Playlists form the backone of the player; great for people like me
    who like to compile sub-sections of songs for car journeys and the
    like!
-   Smart playlists: you get playlists which can update based on how
    your rate them; which artist or what genre; sorting conditions ar
    infinite! Example is a 5 Star playlisat with all my top rated tunes!
-   &lt;a href=&quot;http://amarok.kde.org/wiki/Dynamic_Playlist_Walkthrough&quot;&gt;Dynamic
    playlists&lt;/a&gt;:
    built from your static and smart playlists; it can show the last X
    songs you played and Y upcoming. So I could select my 5 star faves
    and my Strokes favourites; set it to show 5 last played songs and 15
    upcoming. I never need to edit the playlist again as it will auto
    choose and update the list!
-   Statistics: Show all your stats on your collection! From favourite
    artists to most played albums: it&amp;rsquo;s all there waiting!
-   &lt;a href=&quot;http://last.fm/&quot;&gt;Last.fm&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Tags: Tag and compiles your music
    listening tastes with integration in the most popular social music
    site online!
-   IPod integration is second to none (as well as many 0ther popular
    players!)! Amarok will convert it to mp3; sync podcasts and
    playlists; transfer ratings and even submit listened tracks to
    last.fm!
-   All the added extras: Equaliser with presets; Random and Repeat
    capability; Visualisations! You can even sort you collection by mood
    with Moodbar installed!&lt;br /&gt;
-   Scripts!?! One of the coolest thing is scripts: think Firefox
    extensions only slightly more powerful!
-   Built-in editing of song names; album names and all info! Don&amp;rsquo;t
    bother telling Amarok to add the music you just ripped; as long as
    it&amp;rsquo;s in your music folder its automatically picked up and added!
-   An intuitive interface: built for function and power: Amarok is
    almost perfect in its balance between feature and function. The OSD
    )On-Screen Display) with show you any details your playlist does;
    like Artist Name; Album name; Rating and how long a track is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man I am exhausted already and I haven&amp;rsquo;t even covered all of the
features; their is just too many hidden gems I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing you
justice by telling you them all (see: Scripts)! That&amp;rsquo;s why Amarok rocks
my world! (As a side note: &lt;a href=&quot;http://amarok.kde.org/wiki/Users_in_Amarok_Gear&quot;&gt;yes I will get my picture on this page
eventually!&lt;/a&gt;)

      <title>A few days with A Nokia N810</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/01/13/few-days-with-nokia-n810/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 Jan 2008 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2008/01/13/few-days-with-nokia-n810</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/R4qHd3krvrI/AAAAAAAABTQ/EEVzzCX5IGs/s1600-h/HPIM0193.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/R4qHd3krvrI/AAAAAAAABTQ/EEVzzCX5IGs/s320/HPIM0193.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dueyfinster.com/2007/10/nokia-n810-tablet-to-hit-shops-soon.html&quot;&gt;I last discussed the Nokia N810 Internet Tablet in
October&lt;/a&gt;;
when details were only starting to filter out. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t expected for
Nokia to introduce an upgrade to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dueyfinster.com/2007/02/nokia-n800-review.html&quot;&gt;N800 Internet Tablet (which I also
reviewed
here)&lt;/a&gt; so
soon. I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t envy the position of a small team getting the
hardware and software for a mini-computer right in such a short space of
time. But needless to say the N810 feels right; in fact it feels more
right than the N770 which I thought had the best design of all (be it
functionality not so much style). The N810 has bags of style; in a
flashy brand-new-car sort of way; it looks expensive and I believe Nokia
plays to this in their pricing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well the best new feature has to be the operating system: OS 2008. It is
clean; stable enough and illustrates beautifully in a Apple Mac sort of
way when hardware and software are matched beautifully you get an
unrivaled product. But that runs on N800 also; so why bother with the
N810? GPS is inbuilt for one; but the mapping software is pretty
horrible. Luckily the Open Source MaemoMapper is the original (and still
the best) GPS program for any maemo platform (OS 2007, OS 2006). No
offence to WayFinder but their software isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal and feels like a
shabby port to the Internet Tablets; like it was ripped off another
device and thrown at Nokia&amp;rsquo;s devices. Nokia also dropped the ball in
other areas; such as keylocking and the home applets: home applets are
little bubbles of information you immeadiatly see on the N810&amp;rsquo;s home
screen. The problem you ask? The move (by design; older OS ones were
fixed) and the keylock made to keep them stable is not functional as I
believe it could be. Why can&amp;rsquo;t I set an auto screen lock when I flip the
keyboard back in? That kind of commission is what I&amp;rsquo;d call a &amp;lsquo;schoolboy
error&amp;rsquo;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/R4qIGHkrvsI/AAAAAAAABTY/W7lgUeEHphE/s1600-h/HPIM0195.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/R4qIGHkrvsI/AAAAAAAABTY/W7lgUeEHphE/s320/HPIM0195.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apps make any device
and the N810 has a few good ones; but nothing totally wow or killer just
yet. Skype as many people are aware is semi-included in the device
(after a download) and as of yet unlike its desktop Linux counterpart;
it lacks full video support (on a device with a decent vga webcam camera
- no sense here!). There is also full GoogleTalk integration; with SIP
support coming up (perhaps with full video on SIP; maybe as of yet with
GoogleTalk if they adopt SIP?). Other than that great apps include
FBreader a great Windows/Linux ebook reader; and some fun pass the time
games like TuxPuck, IceBreaker and LXDoom can be downloaded. What about
the apps included I hear you ask? Well the Web Browser is quality from
Mozilla and far outshines the Opera browser which graced both the N770
and N800. Updates are not really noticeable in the core non-essential
apps like Email (an awful excuse for an email client), RSS reader
(decent enough) and Filemanager. To the core I suspect they made a bevy
of changes; but I&amp;rsquo;m not that hardcore so I&amp;rsquo;ll skip technical details
like that; needless to say its startup time was reduced; battery life
seems longer; and it feels more responsive on OS 2008.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So should I buy it?
If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a N800 I would say definitely go for it; as long as
you
think&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/R4qIVnkrvtI/AAAAAAAABTg/RxlmVSws4JY/s1600-h/HPIM0194.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/R4qIVnkrvtI/AAAAAAAABTg/RxlmVSws4JY/s320/HPIM0194.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
the price is right. As with any tech device; shop around for a bargain
on the price over Nokia&amp;rsquo;s retail listed price. Who is it aimed at?
People in college like me who like to keep in touch with friends; read
their pdfs docs; and cringe to be away from some sort of connectivity.
This also applies to business users who would have similar uses with
clients; but unfortunately the necessity of a second device in non-wifi
connected areas kills this devices true potential until Nokia decides to
inbuild 3G or Wimax.   &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nokia N810 Tablet to hit the shops soon...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nokia have
announced an upgrade to the N800 Internet tablet, called the N810. I
suspect its called that because it is more of an incremental upgrade
than a total visual refresh it was going from an Nokia 770 to N800. Here
it is:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/RxtiosvqOFI/AAAAAAAABMc/vdtUwZ0FeFA/s1600-h/n810gps.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/RxtiosvqOFI/AAAAAAAABMc/vdtUwZ0FeFA/s320/n810gps.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

Talk&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sports a nice new hardware keyboard; inbuilt GPS (For satellite
mapping) and OS 2008 (an upgrade to the operating system it runs). The
N800 will also benefit from OS 2008, which will include GoogleTalk,
Skype, Mozilla browser, among the usual such as its email client, media
player, file manager, control panel, assorted games and an image/PDF
viewer. The one feature it will emit is an inbuilt FM Radio, which was
axed to make the N810 a smaller tablet. It still retains the best screen
size for web browsing, bluetooth connectivity, and of course Wifi which
is central to the tablets existance! No word on what easter eggs are
included if any; on the N800 it was a radio and the N770 it was the
microphone. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2007/10/17/nokia-n810-hands-on/&quot;&gt;Engadget has a great writeup on
it&lt;/a&gt;,
choc-a-bloc full of high resolution photos with size comparisons to
Apples iPhone.

      <title>Apple Mac OS X: the most popular Desktop Unix?</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/10/21/apple-mac-os-x-most-popular-desktop/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apple does it again: explosive growth in the computer market,
no doubt in part to its
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html&quot;&gt;Macbook&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/&quot;&gt;Macbook
Pro&lt;/a&gt; line of laptops. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/&quot;&gt;Ars
Technica&lt;/a&gt; points out:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; As &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/07/19/apple-poised-to-become-number-three-pc-maker-in-us&quot;&gt;predicted last
&amp;gt; quarter&lt;/a&gt;,
&amp;gt; however, Apple broke its tie for third place with Gateway by shipping
&amp;gt; 1.33 million units and growing by a whopping 37.2 percent (double that
&amp;gt; of any other US vendor) from third quarter 2006 to claim 8.1 percent
&amp;gt; of the US market for the quarter. These numbers also continue the
&amp;gt; company&amp;rsquo;s trend of steadily gaining market share &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/03/02/7296&quot;&gt;every two
&amp;gt; quarters&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; for at least the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the graph of the figures:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071018-dell-staunches-the-market-share-bleeding-while-apple-sees-big-growth.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh4.google.com/ngrogan/RxqyS8vqOCI/AAAAAAAABMQ/ac5ZKoT9QLI/s400/Screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it the most popular desktop
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX&quot;&gt;UNIX&lt;/a&gt;? No, as until
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&quot;&gt;Leopard&lt;/a&gt; comes out it is not officially a
UNIX stamped and sealed &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX&quot;&gt;POSIX&lt;/a&gt;
compliant system; but then again neither is
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has the benefit of reporting
numbers with hard sales; something thats impossible for Linux. With
estimates of 22 million Mac users, compared to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fedoraproject.org/&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;
(the two most popular user-friendly distributions) which reported 8
million dynamic &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address&quot;&gt;IP&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; updating
from mirrors (16 million total). That doesn&amp;rsquo;t include
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novell.com/linux/&quot;&gt;SuSe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://redhat.com/&quot;&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slackware.com/&quot;&gt;Slackware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://debian.org/&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mandriva.com/&quot;&gt;Mandriva&lt;/a&gt; and other popular distributions, which
means Linux has most likely a bigger install base, although Apple is
gaining ground fast. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://cmdrtaco.net/&quot;&gt;Rob Malda&lt;/a&gt; (founder of
popular geek news site: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slashdot.org/&quot;&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/10/11/1527219&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Linux will have a strong position on the server for a long time, but
&amp;gt; as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnome.org/&quot;&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org/&quot;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; bickered with each other,
&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Appl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;e&lt;/a&gt; came along and
&amp;gt; gave the world a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&quot;&gt;great desktop UNIX&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;gt; It&amp;rsquo;s sad, but true, and there&amp;rsquo;s a huge lesson to learn there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Linux and Patents: Just Patently Wrong</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/10/12/linux-and-patents-just-patently-wrong/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Oct 2007 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/10/12/linux-and-patents-just-patently-wrong</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I read the news &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/12/novell_red_hat_linux_patent_sued/&quot;&gt;Novell and Red Hat are being sued for
patent
infringement&lt;/a&gt;.
This is all about multiple workspaces that can hold various graphical
user elements, a Xerox Parc patent which dates to the early 1990&amp;rsquo;s.
Xerox Palo Alto Research center invented the graphical user interface in
the 1980&amp;rsquo;s, only to been, licensed and used by Steve Jobs in Mac OS
Classic. Now IP Innovation, a submarine patent troll, who make no
products and bought the patent want their payday. The logical step is to
go after the biggest infringer to set a precedent for your patent, and
then make your way to all the smaller companies who infringe. Well
logically of course that would be Apple or Microsoft. Apple has already
paid them a reported 20 million dollars, and well no-one knows what
Microsoft has done, but this fish is smelly. From the Register
Article:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; The complaint, available
&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/IPvRH-1.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as a pdf, says &amp;ldquo;the Red
&amp;gt; Hat Linux system, the Novell Suse Linux Enterprise Desktop and the
&amp;gt; Novell Suse Linux Enterprise Server all breach held patents. The
&amp;gt; companies seek increased damages for the willful infringements of
&amp;gt; their patents and an injunction to prevent further infringements&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we already know they bought a patent thats years old, are patent
trolls, they extorted money from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; appears to have no dealings with
them. But wait! We see Steve Ballmer (Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s CEO) saying recently
Linux should have to pay like Microsoft does in the &amp;ldquo;IP Regime&amp;rdquo;. Regime
always seemed a rather nasty word to me, something your forced to put up
with - like Robert Mugabes regime in Zimbabwe; come to think of it
Steve, I would have said that exact same thing - a dirty rotten evil
patent regime - but thats not what you meant. You meant you wanted a cut
for every Linux support contract and if its free like
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; - well though, you want money anyway.
Steve you claim innovation Microsoft produced is in Linux, but refuse to
show any evidence. Your bold statements which could be considered
illegal under Sarbanes-Oxley in the United States hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped you.
But a patent lawsuit has, you know it will destroy Microsoft and can
never kill Linux- maybe Linux business but you&amp;rsquo;d settle for that (If we
can&amp;rsquo;t make money off it, no one can!). Now we have a patent troll, and
Open Source legal resources &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071011205044141&quot;&gt;Groklaw has exposed it to employ Microsoft
employees who specialise in
patents&lt;/a&gt;. We
are well aware as a community you have a hand in this - how much remains
to be seen. The community warned you through the Open Invention network
( a patent clearinghouse which vows to protect open source through
pooled patents by Sony, HP, IBM, Google, Phillips, Novell, Oracle, Red
Hat and others) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitaltippingpoint.com/wiki/index.php?title=Sue_me_first,_microsoft&quot;&gt;a petition of thousands of people to put up or shut
up about
patents&lt;/a&gt;.
Now you have released SCO II when we are done killing off the first one
- through copyrights - now its patents. Well we are not going to stand
for this any more; I am hoping Red Hat and Novell stand strong and fight
this; and I hope the lawyers at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/&quot;&gt;Open Invention
Network&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.softwarefreedom.org/&quot;&gt;the Software Freedom
Law center&lt;/a&gt; seriously consider a
pre-emptive attack on you. We&amp;rsquo;re all peace loving hippies in open source
right? Wrong, wrong and now I think it is time we make YOU pay&amp;hellip;..

      <title>Planning the Computer Build</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/10/09/planning-computer-build/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Planning to build a computer can be fun also. Researching parts, making
sure they work well together (if they are on Manufacturers QVL). Making
a list of all the parts you need is the beginning of the purchasing,
assembly and then seeing your machine in action! Lots of guides online
help with the planning stage; but nearly all are advice and tips. How do
you know which is biased? Are the benchmarks relevant to what you are
building your machine for? Probably not most of the time. If you&amp;rsquo;re not
a hardcore gamer like myself, your machine can mid-range and cheaper
than a pre-built solution, saving you money. I am using my machine as a
long term investment: I plan to have it long into the future and just
replace components. I think that could save me at least €3000 over ten
years (two €1,500 machines every 5 years, not beyond possibility) if not
more. I can also re-use perfectly good parts when my other machines have
departed to that big waste recycling plant in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One tool besides lots of online-based computer review reading is a
custom made spreadsheet I created for the job. It allows me to see Part
name, Quantity, Unit Price, Delivery Cost, Part Description, Link to
Manufacturers site and best of all: it&amp;rsquo;s easily modified for other
items. I coloured it real nice too; so its easy to read and understand.
I hope it&amp;rsquo;s useful to anyone out there, so I am making it available
under CC-BY-NC-SA. Here is a screenshot of it:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Computer Systems - Dismantling PC's is fun!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found a new pastime: dismantling pc&amp;rsquo;s. It my not sound like great
fun, but its a challenge to do it right and make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t break
your pc at the end of it all. Nothing feels of so much relief when you
see the BIOS boot up again after ripping everything you can out and
cramming it all back in. It stands to you in developing problem solving
skills, which of course employers love. It is so much more visual than
any theory, plus it is what the majority of people like: physical
objects like Lego going together. I am writing this on a computer I
stripped everything out of at the moment: a Dell 3100c, a Celeron D
machine I bought in August of last year. Today I dismantled a very old
Optiplex PIII, and the difference between the machines is marked, even
though there are only a few years between them. I have included some
photos below to show the inside internals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is My Dell 3100c Internals:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Apple - Play Nice....</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/09/15/apple-play-nice/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Sep 2007 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/09/15/apple-play-nice</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/RuxkSFmzdLI/AAAAAAAABBs/wij7hmtcbd0/s1600-h/AppleLogo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/RuxkSFmzdLI/AAAAAAAABBs/wij7hmtcbd0/s320/AppleLogo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Is the much beloved Apple the new Microsoft? First there was IBM, the
big all crushing corporate machine that was humbled by the next big
giant in the form of Microsoft, so it seems Apple&amp;rsquo;s turn is long
overdue. The next few weeks are crucial to this crossroads in which
Apple finds itself: It owes a HUGE amount to the BSD (an open source
Unix clone) which is the foundation for not just OS X, but the iPhone
and now the iPod Touch. Basically without the kernel that runs these
fantastic devices, Apple would still be up shit creek without a paddle.
Granted the iPod would have been a huge success probably still, but OS
X&amp;rsquo;s core is the foundation for the real money making Apple will do over
the next few years, a point that is not lost on Mr. Jobs as the company
intelligently markets different segments to different markets of which I
have first hand experience of: Go to the Apple site for education and
they extol the brilliance of a Macbook and make they deal sweeter by
throwing in an iPod Nano. But if you go to a link I was provided in a
college advert; they bring to a page pointing out key areas a mac can
make a difference. I picked Computer Science naturally, and the site
extolled the virtues of Open Source, a Unix base and programming tools
like Xcode.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So whats the big deal? Well the fact &lt;a href=&quot;http://apple.slashdot.org/apple/07/09/14/1831236.shtml&quot;&gt;the new iPods are locked solid
with a new encrypted hash, meaning nothing besides iTunes will work with
the new iPods&lt;/a&gt;.
The iPhone also gets similar treatment, no third party development is
allowed: no only Apple Applications are allowed. This stinks to high
heavens of monopolistic behavior akin to Microsoft or IBM of old. Not to
mention gouging both networks and customers with the iPhone. Apple may
not yet be important enough to endure the wrath of the European Union
Antitrust bodies or the US Department of Justice; but they are certainly
on a slippery slope as the popularity of their products and lock in seem
to increase day by day. Interestingly enough Apple may be also feeling
the heat of Linux, with the much-famed poster child of the free software
revolution now making it into Apple&amp;rsquo;s marketing material; meaning Apple
sees Linux as a future threat. After taking so much from Open Source,
including the GNU Tool chain, the BSD Kernel, the Samba Networking
protocols to interact with Windows (to name a few) Apple should be a
good free software citizen and not aggravate core customers like myself
of which Open source is a key factor in OS X.

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/09/07/comp-sci-interview-with-stanfords</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the guy who runs Stanford University Undergraduate programme. He
talks about the future of computer science:&lt;br /&gt;
-   Computer Science will evolve more than most other subjects as it
    expands into other areas, especially Biology and other areas people
    don&amp;rsquo;t normally associate with it
-   Industry ties with Colleges are going to be very important
-   Computer Science with Law is the next big area&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scobleizer.com/2007/08/31/google-sun-yahoo-hp-cisco-and/&quot;&gt;Robert Scoble for doing the
interview&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tftxZawYL._SS500_.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tftxZawYL._SS500_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The
Ubuntu Book (2nd Edition) is a nicely put together book for dealing with
the Linux operating system in a number of clearly laid out and well
presented chapters. Chapters are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
1.  Introducing Ubuntu
2.  Installing Ubuntu
3.  Using Ubuntu on the Desktop
4.  Advanced Usage and Managing Ubuntu
5.  Ubuntu Server
6.  Support / Typical Problems
7.  Using Kubuntu
8.  Ubuntu Community
9.  Ubuntu-Related Projects
10. Using Edubuntu&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is a very complete introduction and contains suprising
elements related to finding out and joining the community of users -
which you will not find in other Ubuntu Books (such as O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s Ubuntu
Hacks) which make it a unique and worthwhile addition to any Ubuntu
users personal library. It is most helpful to new users to Ubuntu, which
sections on installing and help with problems that could be faced.
Having said that, it falls short on the amount of truly unique
information that it contains - most of the books contents can be found
on the web. What you are paying for is a well-laid out, well written
account of the Ubuntu-sphere and all that goes along with it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price of €37.50 which I paid (less in the US, about $34.99 RRP)
might be a bit much for some, but when you consider the operating system
itself is free, you can easily justify the cost. A DVD comes included
with the book which contains Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Edubuntu, rather handy
if you do not want to download the cd image.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Server section is obviously a bit more for the advanced user, but
still is a quint introduction to the basics which is 34 pages long -
probably not enough to warrant a purchase by a sever administrator or
other power server user. The Edubuntu section offers an introduction to
the school-based flavour of Ubuntu which tips on how they differ and
administration of multiple machines (including a nice introduction to
thin clients and servers for schools).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whos the book for?&lt;br /&gt;
People new to Ubuntu, people moving from Windows, School Administrators
all fit the test case. If your an Ubuntu power user, don&amp;rsquo;t mind taking
down your system or messing with the kernel than you should stick to
online help. However I bought the book to show to others and promote
Ubuntu as a viable and successful alternative to Mac OS X and Windows -
it gives a great impression of the project and it&amp;rsquo;s success to date and
I also bought it to support Ubuntu financially.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Rating: 8.5/10

      <title>Microsoft settles with Eolas over Internet Explorer</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/08/31/microsoft-settles-with-eolas-over/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbi.cnptia.embrapa.br/xmeeting/include/img/microsoft-logo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.cbi.cnptia.embrapa.br/xmeeting/include/img/microsoft-logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/news.nv?storyid=single9119&quot;&gt;Microsoft has settled with
Eolas&lt;/a&gt;
over a number of patents regarding browser plugins which chicago based
Eolas filed patents for in 1998. A jury in Chicago then found Microsoft
guilty of infringing on Eolas’ patents and was told to pay $521m US
Dollars in &amp;lsquo;damages&amp;rsquo;. That ruling was overturned and a fresh trial
ordered which was due to start very soon, but it seems Microsoft has
decided to pay out:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gottabemobile.com/blogimages/InternetExplorer7issettobereleasedthroug_62B6/ie73.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gottabemobile.com/blogimages/InternetExplorer7issettobereleasedthroug_62B6/ie73.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Details
&amp;gt; of the settlement have not yet been released but Eolas Technologies’
&amp;gt; chief operating officer, Mark Swords, told the New York Times that a
&amp;gt; certain number of Eolas’ shareholders would get US$60 to US$72 per
&amp;gt; share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is a sign of a deep crisis in the technology industry as a
whole when companies have to pay out over patents over which the holder
has no product. With patents there should be a use em&amp;rsquo; or lose em&amp;rsquo;
theme. My biggest concern now is that I hope Microsoft are not trying to
validate the patent by paying out and then encouraging Eolas to use it
against competitors, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060823-7575.html&quot;&gt;sort of like the Apple and Creative
deal&lt;/a&gt; comes to
mind.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Gutsy coming along, Update to Dell Windows Refund..</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/08/29/gutsy-coming-along-update-to-dell/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2007 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/08/29/gutsy-coming-along-update-to-dell</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/themes/ubuntu07/images/ubuntulogo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/themes/ubuntu07/images/ubuntulogo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I just tried Herd 5 of Gutsy Gibbon, a beta release which will be Ubuntu
07.10 released in October. Obviously it is still early stages and a lot
of things aren&amp;rsquo;t working quite as they should, but it looks very
promising. Here&amp;rsquo;s some new stuff which should hit the final release:&lt;br /&gt;
-   Compiz Fusion - Pretty Graphics that leave you in awe&amp;hellip;
-   Bullet Proof X - Making sure you&amp;rsquo;ll never see a terminal prompt not
    of your own choosing, basically the graphics server should be
    &amp;lsquo;bulletproof&amp;rsquo;
-   Appearance Manager - Making it easier to change yourbuntu&amp;rsquo;s look and
    feel
-   Better Driver Support - More of those restricted drivers to make
    sure you can see your screen and use your wifi card
-   Simplified Codecs install - It will now be painless, install
    ubuntu-restrictedcodecs (or kubuntu-restricted codecs) and you can
    see Youtube in all its glory, play a dvd, watch that porno WMV file
    (just kidding but I think thats all WMV is used for) and other such
    niceties of the propreitry world we have to put up with
-   Firefox Codecs Plugin - Firefox will be hooked up to the package
    manager and prompt to install Flash/Java if you haven&amp;rsquo;t got it
    already, much the same way it prompts to get a codec when you throw
    a file at it that it cannot play in the movie player. The free
    software Gnash replacement for Flash will come as standard and can
    play Youtube Vids.
-   Dual Screen Glory - If your like me you have a nice and small
    portable laptop, but that screen just won&amp;rsquo;t do all of the time,
    thats why I personally have a 19&amp;rdquo; to plug my 13&amp;rdquo; MacBook into. With
    Gutsy I should be able to plug and play over DVI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the features that are being worked on for the
final release. Probably not all of them on the list will get into Gutsy
final, but lets hope they do! Gutsy+1 (slated for release April 2008)
has been announced as &amp;ldquo;Hardy Hereon&amp;rdquo; and should be a long term release
(5 years server and 3 years desktop updates and
patches).&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.kir.com/archives/dell_logo2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.kir.com/archives/dell_logo2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dell refunded me €18.15 for Windows Home Edition, to be honest I thought
I&amp;rsquo;d get more, but alas that&amp;rsquo;s life&amp;hellip;..

      <title>Dell refunds me for Windows!</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/08/21/dell-refunds-me-for-windows/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Aug 2007 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/08/21/dell-refunds-me-for-windows</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As many of you know
I am a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/mac&quot;&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.ie/search?q=define:aficionado&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&quot;&gt;aficionado&lt;/a&gt;.
For my Linux machines, all of them are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dell.com/open&quot;&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;.
I have been always pleased with Dells prices, how their machines work
with Linux, their customer service and the fact they are made in
Limerick, Ireland (I am from Ireland). I politely emailed Dell (well got
up on my high horse), heres my first mail:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; I would like a refund of Windows XP since I am installing Ubuntu Linux
&amp;gt; on the computer when I get it. When I turn on the computer I am going
&amp;gt; to decline the EULA, and I am within my rights to request this refund
&amp;gt; (as part of Irish consumer laws). This also applies in Britian, see
&amp;gt; here: (
&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6144782.stm&quot;&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6144782.stm&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the most polite, but I was trying to make a point
because I guessed they&amp;rsquo;d be not &amp;lsquo;welcome&amp;rsquo; to the idea. Boy was I wrong,
I got a lovely call from a Dell representitive telling me they would
refund it:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; As per our phone conversation I have arranged for you to be refunded
&amp;gt; for this part. Please allow approximately 5 working days for the money
&amp;gt; to show back on your credit card.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; If you have any further queries please do not hesitate in responding
&amp;gt; directly to this mail and I will be glad to assist you further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I can say is I am definitely a Dell customer from now on. The sad
part of this story is perhaps Dell is out of pocket because of licensing
deals with Microsoft. But they did the right thing, and that is
honourable, it seems &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dellideastorm.com/&quot;&gt;IdeaStorm&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dell&quot;&gt;Michael Dell&lt;/a&gt; returning is
working. I would gladly deny the refund. Why did I do this? I did it
because I oppose the ridiculous notion every PC has to come with
Windows, its like selling all black cars. People want choice and
variety, and consumer laws are supposed to protect and promote this ;-)
I won&amp;rsquo;t be using
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsxp/default.mspx&quot;&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;
and I will be true to my word and deny the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/home/eula.mspx&quot;&gt;EULA&lt;/a&gt; as soon as I
receive the laptop.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bootnote: Ubuntu Dells are available in France, Germany, UK and the US
but not in Ireland. I ordered through small business and specced the
laptop to the exact parts the Ubuntu Inspirons in the US have, all that
is different is the model numbers. Come on Dell, sell those Ubuntu
machines in Ireland, I&amp;rsquo;ll buy another!!

      <title>Have you got viruses or spyware? Here's my tips!</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/08/16/have-you-got-viruses-or-spyware-heres/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Aug 2007 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/08/16/have-you-got-viruses-or-spyware-heres</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I come into contact everyday with people asking how to fix
their machines due to the inevitable spyware and viruses found on a
Windows machine. Lately I have been switching people to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, and even getting them to buy machines
to install it on (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dell.com/open&quot;&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;). But I understand
and have no zealotry for Linux when it comes to fixing peoples&amp;rsquo; real
world problems. I always mention &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; as a
matter of course, and also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/mac&quot;&gt;Macs&lt;/a&gt;. I follow up
peoples Ubuntu installs with friendly emails explaining the free help
open to them, but also as common (probably moreso) are my emailed tips
to people guiding them how to fix there Windows XP computer. So I&amp;rsquo;ll
list the steps here which are generic and should help anyone out their
with such problems; this is not a miracle cure and I fix these problems
on a case by case basis, so expect better perfromance, but not a new
computer!!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; 1.  Go to Control Panel (Click on My Computer, then a link to it
&amp;gt;     appears at the side) &amp;gt; Add/Remove Programs
&amp;gt; 2.  Remove all Norton Antivirus and/or Symantec Security products
&amp;gt; 3.  Download This: &lt;a href=&quot;http://files.avast.com/iavs4pro/setupeng.exe&quot;&gt;Avast Home Edition
&amp;gt;     4&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; 4.  When Avast installs and asks to perform a boot time scan, click:
&amp;gt;     yes, then restart your computer as it suggests&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; 5.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avast.com/eng/home-registration.php&quot;&gt;Register for a (free) Avast Home Edition 4 Serial
&amp;gt;     key&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; 6.  Start Avast from the Start Menu (Start &amp;gt; All Programs &amp;gt; Avast).
&amp;gt;     It will flash an &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; on a round ball in the status area, click it
&amp;gt;     and enter serial number recieved in email&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; 7.  Download: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spybotupdates.com/files/spybotsd14.exe&quot;&gt;Spybot Search and
&amp;gt;     Destroy&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; 8.  It will guide you through this when it starts up the first time:
&amp;gt;     Backup your registry, download all available updates, immunise and
&amp;gt;     then do a full scan (it sounds harder then it is), then remove all
&amp;gt;     spyware&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also mention the open source &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clamav.net/&quot;&gt;ClamAV&lt;/a&gt;,
but I find Avast more suitable for this guide. I hope this helps fix
issues that people have. I hate to see new computers being bought every
day when the old ones can be made to run very fast with the right amount
of TLC!

      <title>Seven financial reasons not to use Windows</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/08/06/seven-financial-reasons-not-to-use/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2007 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/08/06/seven-financial-reasons-not-to-use</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://img516.imageshack.us/my.php?image=windowslogo2oy4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img516.imageshack.us/img516/8713/windowslogo2oy4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I recently read a very insightful article on 7 factors every company
should seriously consider about Microsoft Windows, here they are
summarised:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Licensing Costs&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Everyone in the IT industry today knows that proprietary operating
&amp;gt; systems and the applications that run on them will cost you a lot of
&amp;gt; money on licensing fees. According to a recent Forrester study, U.S.
&amp;gt; companies overall are expected to spend $100 billion on software
&amp;gt; maintenance in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hardware Costs&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;You need to throw lots of hardware at it,&amp;rdquo; says Central Desktop
&amp;gt; founder Arnulf Hsu about Windows. The minimum hardware requirements
&amp;gt; for Server 2003 call for a Pentium III 550MHz, 512MB of RAM, and at
&amp;gt; least a 3GB hard drive. Linux, on the other hand, can go on an old
&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cio.com/article/126950/subject/Intel+Pentium+Processors&quot; title=&quot;More stories related to Intel Pentium Processors&quot;&gt;Pentium
&amp;gt; II&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; with only 64MB of RAM and 1GB of hard drive space.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inefficient Security Control&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; It&amp;rsquo;s going to take more labor to keep a Windows system secure. Virus
&amp;gt; makers and crackers target Windows systems because it is easier to
&amp;gt; break into.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heavy Vendor Influence&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Because so many corporations have a company policy that specifies
&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Microsoft-only,&amp;rdquo; it discourages independent thinking and
&amp;gt; technological savvy; many end up simply relying on the sales guy to
&amp;gt; tell them what applications they need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inefficient use of Manpower&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; While it is true that it is relatively easy to find Windows-skilled IT
&amp;gt; admins, it&amp;rsquo;s still not exactly cheap. Though many Unix-based admins
&amp;gt; are more expensive, it takes fewer of them to maintain more servers,
&amp;gt; which saves money in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feature Lock-in&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Proprietary systems like Windows are not easily customizable.
&amp;gt; Companies that need the flexibility to drop in or remove features on
&amp;gt; an as-needed basis find themselves either paying for unneeded feature
&amp;gt; bloat, starving for the features they do need because commercial
&amp;gt; vendors rarely are willing to drop everything to accommodate a one-off
&amp;gt; request&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forced Upgrade Path&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; With Microsoft, you&amp;rsquo;re on a forced upgrade path. Once it drops support
&amp;gt; on your version of Windows, you&amp;rsquo;re out of luck when it comes to fixing
&amp;gt; those above mentioned security holes-if you can even continue to use
&amp;gt; that version.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cio.com/article/126950/&quot;&gt;full article on CIO is here&lt;/a&gt;,
and is a very interesting read (it expands on the points I quoted
above). No person in a company responsible for IT should go without
reading this, especially if your are a &amp;ldquo;Microsoft-Only&amp;rdquo; shop.  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HP to Follow Dell into Open Source? and Ubuntu Home Server</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/07/08/hp-to-follow-dell-into-open-source/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Jul 2007 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/07/08/hp-to-follow-dell-into-open-source</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;HP it seems is responding to Dell&amp;rsquo;s initiative to
sell Ubuntu on their computers. With the Ubuntu Dells reportedly selling
very well and Dell rolling out the program worldwide, this hasn&amp;rsquo;t
escaped the notice of the world&amp;rsquo;s number one computer manufacturer - HP.
This is speculation from blogs that has been going on for months since
Dell started to offer Ubuntu. The Direct to Dell Blog states:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; This &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomdryer.com/blog/index.php/2007/07/03/is-hp-going-to-start-offering-ubuntu/&quot;&gt;recent post from Tom
&amp;gt; Dryer&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; caught my eye a couple of days ago, and thought I&amp;rsquo;d comment on it
&amp;gt; here. If the rumors about HP offering Ubuntu are true, we&amp;rsquo;re glad to
&amp;gt; see other vendors join us in support of Ubuntu and open source. We
&amp;gt; welcome HP and other system vendors that want to join in this
&amp;gt; initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very good news indeed and I am glad Dell is being very receptive
to the idea, they even made this humorous video about their new foray
into Open Source:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntuhomeserver.org/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu Home Server&lt;/a&gt; is a newly
announced project by Ubuntu community members to compete with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/windowshomeserver/default.mspx&quot;&gt;Windows
Home
Server&lt;/a&gt;.
Personally I think Microsoft is barking up the wrong tree with this, I
don&amp;rsquo;t think many home users will bother with this type of product, maybe
it will take off in a couple of years, but most people are not
tech-savvy, and even if they are, chances are there already doing this
with Linux, Xbox360 or a PS3. Many people can&amp;rsquo;t tell me even what a
server is, never mind what it can do. Also it won&amp;rsquo;t make sense because
people expect to have everything on their pc ready to go, and to not
have to purchase another one to throw in a storage closet. Nevertheless
to paraphrase Bill Gates and Steve Jobs at D5 Conference: We Built
things we wanted to have. So in that tone and considering the Home
server product is just modified Windows (it would not cost as much as
say a whole new project like Zune or Xbox 360), I can see where
Microsoft is betting that this is one of many avenues in the future.
Personally I think it will be specialised hardware devices that will win
this space, like Intel VIIV, Apple TV or one of the many consoles I
mentioned.

      <title>Windows Vista Security - Better than Linux?</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/07/03/windows-vista-security-better-than/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Jul 2007 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/07/03/windows-vista-security-better-than</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.csoonline.com/node/218&quot;&gt;nice article written by Jeff
Jones&lt;/a&gt;, a security researcher for
Microsoft. He says &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.csoonline.com/exactly_how_biased_am_i&quot;&gt;he isn&amp;rsquo;t
biased&lt;/a&gt;, saying he
worked over 75% of his career outside Microsoft, using Slackware Linux,
Unix, HP Unix etc. He claims Windows Vista has less security holes than
popular versions of Linux, such as Ubuntu (he also compares Red Hat,
Novell, Mac OS X). First let me say why his facts are distorted, and why
he knows his facts are distorted. His facts do raise an issue of slow
patching of vulnerabilities across the software Industry, but Linux
performs the best consistently because anyone can audit the code. Here&amp;rsquo;s
why his comparisons are uneven:&lt;br /&gt;
-   Linux is open source, so various tools can be used to find
    vulnerabilities. We don&amp;rsquo;t have this luxury with Windows, any holes
    found are needles in a haystack, but the target of the Windows
    monopoly allows greater incentive to find these needles
-   Linux has used SUDO and ROOT users properly since its inception
    (Think of Administrator in Windows). Anyone who is not a root user
    on Linux cannot install programs, make system wide changes, and you
    can even stop them from using USB keys, CD Drives etc if you are
    paranoid. Now this has received much attention, Vista has
    retroactively inserted this kind of security, but by my experience,
    it is very obtrusive, and can be switched off. Root in Linux is alot
    harder to stop, and theres no graphical way to do it, so the average
    user won&amp;rsquo;t.
-   A link to my second point above, Programs in Linux can only access
    what they need to, the home folder of the user that is running it
    and very little else. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the case is in Vista, but in
    Windows XP, almost any program could destroy your system, by picking
    at the much famed registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He provides pretty graphs, let me provide my
own:&lt;a href=&quot;http://secunia.com/graph/?type=sol&amp;amp;period=all&amp;amp;prod=13223&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://secunia.com/graph/?type=sol&amp;amp;period=all&amp;amp;prod=13223&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://secunia.com/graph/?type=sol&amp;amp;period=all&amp;amp;prod=14068&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://secunia.com/graph/?type=sol&amp;amp;period=all&amp;amp;prod=14068&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://secunia.com/graph/?type=cri&amp;amp;period=all&amp;amp;prod=14068&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://secunia.com/graph/?type=cri&amp;amp;period=all&amp;amp;prod=14068&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://secunia.com/graph/?type=cri&amp;amp;period=all&amp;amp;prod=13223&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://secunia.com/graph/?type=cri&amp;amp;period=all&amp;amp;prod=13223&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(click on Graphs to Enlarge)&lt;br /&gt;
As you can see, Ubuntu Linux 7.04 (released April) compares
comparatively better to Vista, available since January. The Graphs are
provided by Secunia, an independent security research firm. Microsoft
often downplays vulnerabilities other companies like Secunia find, which
is also a factor that Jeff Jones did not mention (maybe he forgot?). I
forget where this famous quote comes from but I have paraphrased: &amp;ldquo;You
cannot depend on a man understanding a problem if his salary depends on
him not understanding it&amp;rdquo;, which I think affects Mr. Jeff Jones.

      <title>Threats to Democracy</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/06/26/threats-to-democracy/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Jun 2007 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/06/26/threats-to-democracy</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading about &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUKL253889920070625?feedType=RSS&amp;amp;rpc=451&amp;amp;sp=true&quot;&gt;Tom Cruise
being banned from filming at certain German military sites because of
his belief in
Scientology&lt;/a&gt;,
I was a bit outraged at first, despite my abhorrence of their beliefs,
which I think are crazy and nonsensical.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Scientology_warning_leaflet.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4VvLQrhTX4I/RoDgYqFBZfI/AAAAAAAAAy4/WhYOunewTXY/s320/Scientology_warning_leaflet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; Germany has barred the makers of a movie about a plot to kill Adolf
&amp;gt; Hitler from filming at German military sites because its star Tom
&amp;gt; Cruise is a Scientologist, the Defence Ministry said on Monday.
&amp;gt; Cruise, also one of the film&amp;rsquo;s producers, is a member of the Church of
&amp;gt; Scientology which the German government does not recognise as a
&amp;gt; church. Berlin says it masquerades as a religion to make money, a
&amp;gt; charge Scientology leaders reject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far this seems very unreasonable from the the German Government, to
target a faith based group like that, akin to the Jews perhaps? No, it
is not that at all, Scientology are part of Holocaust denial and
masquerading, blaming it (the Holocaust) on Psychologists. Germany is
just enforcing its rights as a state to use its own systems of law, and
its right to debar anyone whom they see as unfit from entering the
country. If Mr. Cruise was a German citizen, this case would be
different, he most likely would end up in jail like Neo-Nazis do. Is
this unjustified? No I don&amp;rsquo;t think so, although the reporting of it is
unclear at best and confuses people. The German Ministry does not wish
to persecute Mr. Cruise, but as he is a member of an organization who
break a law going back even before L. Ron Hubbard created the myth of
Scientology, a post-World War II law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the picture above you may ask? Well that is the &amp;ldquo;Threats to
Democracy&amp;rdquo;, a picture taken in Nuremburg, Germany (Photo Credit:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Caesura&quot;&gt;Caesura&lt;/a&gt;). Once the bastion
of hate that was the Nuremburg Rallies of WWII, it lists (left to right)
Islamic Extremism, Scientology and Organised Crime as the biggest
threats Western Democracy faces in the 21st Century, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t
agree more. The are all forms of extremism practised by the fringes of
Western Society, and contrary to Western values of the rule of law,
freedom of faith, democracy etc.  &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of
Apple&amp;rsquo;s latest Operating system, have a look at Wikipedia Article on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.5&quot;&gt;Mac OS X Leopard&lt;/a&gt;. Here
are some of the features:&lt;br /&gt;
-   &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(software)&quot; title=&quot;Time Machine (software)&quot;&gt;Time
    Machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:
    an automated backup utility which allows the user to restore files
    that have been deleted or replaced by another version of a file.
-   &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Row&quot; title=&quot;Front Row&quot;&gt;Front Row&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    currently only available with the purchase of a new Mac, but will be
    included with Leopard. It has been reworked to closely resemble the
    interface used by the Apple TV.
-   &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_Booth&quot; title=&quot;Photo Booth&quot;&gt;Photo
    Booth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,
    currently only available with the purchase of a new Mac, but will be

-   &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaces_(software)&quot; title=&quot;Spaces (software)&quot;&gt;Spaces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:
    an implementation of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_desktop&quot; title=&quot;Virtual desktop&quot;&gt;virtual
    desktops&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
    (individually called &amp;ldquo;spaces&amp;rdquo;), allowing users to have multiple
    desktops per user and be able to place certain applications and
    windows in a desktop. Users can organize certain Spaces for certain
    applications (i.e., one for work-related tasks and one for
    entertainment) and switch between them.
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposé_(Mac_OS_X)&quot; title=&quot;Exposé (Mac OS X)&quot;&gt;Exposé&lt;/a&gt;
    will work inside Spaces, allowing the user to see at a glance all
    desktops on one
    screen.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.5#_note-Expos.C3.A9InSpaces&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;)

    Theater&lt;/a&gt;, allowing users
    to incorporate images from
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhoto&quot; title=&quot;IPhoto&quot;&gt;iPhoto&lt;/a&gt;,
    presentations from
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote_(software)&quot; title=&quot;Keynote (software)&quot;&gt;Keynote&lt;/a&gt;,
    and videos from
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTime&quot; title=&quot;QuickTime&quot;&gt;QuickTime&lt;/a&gt; into
    chats; and Backdrops, which are similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_key&quot; title=&quot;Chroma key&quot;&gt;chroma
    keys&lt;/a&gt;, but use
    a real-time difference matte technique which does not require a
    green or blue screen. iChat will also implement desktop sharing, a
    feature previously available with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Remote_Desktop&quot; title=&quot;Apple Remote Desktop&quot;&gt;Apple Remote
    Desktop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.5#_note-9&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.5#_note-10&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.5#_note-11&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt;
-   Enhancements to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_controls&quot; title=&quot;Parental controls&quot;&gt;Parental
    controls&lt;/a&gt;
    include the ability to place restrictions on use of the Internet and
    to set parental controls from anywhere using remote setup.
-   &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICal&quot; title=&quot;ICal&quot;&gt;iCal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; calendar
    sharing and group scheduling.
-   Leopard will also include the software assistant known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_Camp&quot; title=&quot;Boot Camp&quot;&gt;Boot
    Camp&lt;/a&gt;, which has
    been available as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_cycle#Beta&quot; title=&quot;Software release cycle&quot;&gt;beta
    release&lt;/a&gt;
    download for Mac OS X v10.4 from Apple&amp;rsquo;s website since &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_5&quot; title=&quot;April 5&quot;&gt;April
    5&lt;/a&gt;,
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006&quot; title=&quot;2006&quot;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;.This assists the
    installation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP&quot; title=&quot;Windows XP&quot;&gt;Windows
    XP&lt;/a&gt; or
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista&quot; title=&quot;Windows Vista&quot;&gt;Windows
    Vista&lt;/a&gt;
    to a separate partition (or separate internal drive) on Intel-based
    Macs.
-   &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_menu&quot; title=&quot;Apple menu&quot;&gt;Menu Bar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    The new menu bar is now transparent and is no longer rounded like
    all previous Mac OS versions.
-   &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)&quot; title=&quot;Safari (web browser)&quot;&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    3.0 will be included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some seem to be not impressed by Leopard, it is by all accounts an
OS upgrade, with every major application recieving attention. To me I am
overjoyed the finder is getting a revamp, though I am not certain
following iTunes layout is such a good idea. I think this is Steve Jobs
(CEO. Apple Inc) idea to &amp;ldquo;switch&amp;rdquo; windows people since they already use
iTunes, although I am not sure it is the right path. I choose Mac OS X
because its unique, it has a fresh take on how a user interacts with a
computer, moreso than Linux (which adopts tried and true in the case of
Gnome and KDE), and certainly Windows which has only tweaked the look
since Windows 95: its the same concept. The fanning out of dock icons,
and grouping them won&amp;rsquo;t be used by the vast majority of users: its the
same reason they don&amp;rsquo;t use &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; folders: its a feature that has
little in the way of wide appeal. I know the same can be said of the
dashboard, and I personally will most likely end up buying and using
fanning out and collections in Leopard, but my experience of novices is
that they are afraid of the unknown.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps why I wrote this is that I don&amp;rsquo;t understand what people really
expected from Apple. Comments such as &amp;ldquo;everything in Leopard has been
done before&amp;rdquo;, well I think this statement is true of every consumer
Operating System: things (generally) don&amp;rsquo;t get tried out on novice
users. So back to my question: is it worth the wait? Look at the above
list and decide for yourself. I feel Tiger is good enough (then again
Technology never stays still, Bill Gates &amp;ldquo;128K RAM is good enough for
anyone should tell us that), and I predict Leopard will face adoption
like Windows does: Tech buffs will buy the boxed retail version (I
include myself in this), while everybody else will get it through a new
computer purchase.

      <title>HP Photosmart R927 Review</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/06/14/review/</link>

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/06/14/review</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just bought a HP Photosmart R927, an 8 Megapixel camera from
Hewlett-Packard. While I had seen and briefly used one before, I was
excited again upon using my own one (as all tech people are [read:
geeks]). First of all don&amp;rsquo;t confuse me as anyway into photography: I&amp;rsquo;m
not and far from it. I had a criteria in mind when I purchased and this
was it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must work under any OS (Windows [a given], Mac and Linux [latter two
I only use])&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every camera I have come across mounts as a disc drive [think looking at
files on a cd or your local computer], but there is also PTP or &amp;ldquo;Picture
Transfer Protocol&amp;rdquo; in other words it doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear as picture files,
rather PTP triggers your computer to open your camera in your photo
application. I was unsure if this PTP would work under Mac or Linux,
since I had only briefly seen it as an option in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digikam.org/&quot;&gt;digiKam&lt;/a&gt;. It turns out on Mac there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/imagecapture/&quot;&gt;Image
Capture&lt;/a&gt;, and Ubuntu
(My Linux distribution of choice) it automatically detects it and asks
to import photos into&lt;a href=&quot;http://f-spot.org/&quot;&gt;F-Spot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It must have decent Image Quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now decent to me means decent as in &amp;ldquo;a 128kbps MP3 sounds the same as a
cd&amp;rdquo;! I am not talking uber-quality, far from it. There is already a
Samsung 6MP camera in my household, and it more than does the job,
despite occasionally messing up focus and being nearly two years old. I
want a &amp;ldquo;point and click&amp;rdquo; with decent image quality, and I believe we are
mostly there with todays cameras (compared to old 35mm film. I know only
SLR come under the term &amp;ldquo;decent image quality&amp;rdquo; to some [professionals].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It must have portability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phone cameras are an indication of the future, there won&amp;rsquo;t be any real
cameras besides ones used by professionals eventually. Why? Portability.
People don&amp;rsquo;t want 20 devices and the weight attached to it, I have
trouble making sure wallet, keys and my phone are on me, and a camera
adds to this striuggle today.This is the same reason people are ditching
cd&amp;rsquo;s for iPods: portability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;now-for-my-review&quot;&gt;Now for my review:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The R927 looks good, but with camera sizes decreasing, it ends up being
bigger than most. Its brushed metal feel is somewhat amusing, maybe a
tribute to Apple Computers Brushed Metal theme in iTunes? The picture
quality is great, and it certainly matches and beats many other cameras
I have tried. My R927 came with a dock, and the camera itself has only
one port: a usb one [This as I am after finding out is not true, the one
port on the camera is non-standard usb it seems, so it can only be used
through a dock, rather annoying if your travelling it seems to me!]. I
really liked that fact as it clears up clutter and removes confusion,
with only one slot, for one cable (I am thinking of many other similar
sized cameras than try to have the kitchen sink with a port for video, a
second memory card port, usb port, basically: every port possible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its screen is something to behold: bright, clean, clear and crisp. This
apparently comes at a cost though, in a PC World review ( in which this
camera ranked #2 out of #10 &amp;ldquo;Point and Click Cameras&amp;rdquo;), they said it
had the shortest life at 114 photos of any in the top 10. Since I only
have mine a few hours, I can&amp;rsquo;t comment on this yet, but one thing I will
say: the battery is easily replaceable: I found the exact same 3.7 V
Li-ion battery in my Bluetooth GPS Receiver (a low end one), so buying a
backup battery they said might be a good option.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cameras photo manipulation is full featured, as are the menus in
this camera. You can crop, change contrast, brightness, add frames and
dozens of other features without touching photo editing software on a
computer. Is that a plus or minus? Depends on the user really, I might
use it the odd time, but as someone who likes long lasting batteries: it
won&amp;rsquo;t be too often I will. It modes are variful and plenty also: beach
mode, auto mode, landscape, portrait, theatre, panaroma etc. Panorama is
a lot of fun, but it takes a while for the camera to &amp;ldquo;stitch&amp;rdquo; the
photos, and if made out of high quality images: beware, the panorma
won&amp;rsquo;t be as of the same quality. Document Mode puzzled me, the camera
says it captures text clearly. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case in my experience and
with no text recognition software in the camera or accompanying
software, one could be left typing a long document from looking at an
image of one!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s design and layout are elegant and useful. The main navigation d-pad
feels a bit clicky (with a clicky sound to match) and the zoom is
controlled by the far-edges of an upside-down &amp;ldquo;L&amp;rdquo; shape. It has a: Flash
Button, Contrast Button, Sharing Button. Preview button and On/Off. The
sharing button is linked to HP&amp;rsquo;s software and allows you to select
photos to email, print and share upon your connection to a computer. I
found this annoying as I do things manually, but some average users
might consider this a bonus. I got a dock, a power cable, usb cable, and
UK &amp;amp; Ireland plus a European plug within the camera&amp;rsquo;s very nice
package.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I&amp;rsquo;d give it an 8.8/10 so far. Battery life leads me to lower its
score somewhat, and the fact that the camera is bulkier than most. Other
than that it is a great buy, and well recommended thus far. I will
update this if I ever have any problems with it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hard to believe really, Mr.Gates lists Windows Vista &amp;lsquo;innovations&amp;rsquo;. Now
Apple has been shipping everything he mentions since 2005, and I have
tried Vista, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even surpass Apples&amp;rsquo; attempt at the software
(which should be his aim). Some things have been around for years, but
it&amp;rsquo;s how well your software can do it is the key. Personally I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
tout features that another competitor does better, but thats just me. It
seems irresponsible and unbelieveable the head of a public company can
say and get away with this - not knowing the competition that is. I
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t trust my money to anyone who does not keep up with the latest
and greatest trends in the industry.

      <title>Dell Sells Ubuntu 7.04</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/05/26/dell-sells-ubuntu-704/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 May 2007 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/05/26/dell-sells-ubuntu-704</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dell Computers has started
selling Ubuntu Linux 7.04 on consumer machines in the United States.
This can only be good news, as a supporter of Linux since late
2004/early 2005 I am fully behind this initiative to put Linux as a
choice in front of people who buy computers. They are testing the market
at the moment which explains why they are shipping stock drivers with
the hardware, and no multimedia codecs (which is unfortunate, but
understandable that this deal was done in 60 days). I think this is
quite an achievement for Canonical and Mark Shuttleworth (Ubuntu
Founder), as they get to do the traditional Linux business model: you
pay for support, and if you don&amp;rsquo;t need it, you don&amp;rsquo;t buy it. This could
confuse some people in the shorter term, but long term its a winner:
Dell does what it does best (Hardware) and Software is left to Ubuntu&amp;rsquo;s
parent company Canonical. This is opposed to Microsoft getting Dell to
provide support for both hardware and software, sometimes a messy
business in which the consumer does not know which to turn to and can
often be left out in the cold. I hope Dell extends this to Europe and
6the rest of the world soon, and makes a decent stab at promoting a free
software desktop. Dell list advantages in one of their videos:&lt;br /&gt;
-   Free to use
-   Upgrades are free
-   All major software included
-   Not prone to Viruses/Spyware/Malware
-   As easy (if not easier) to use than Apple Mac OS X / Microsoft
    Windows  &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to me, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dueyfinster.com/2007/05/irish-elections-creative-commons.html&quot; title=&quot;RTE, Irish Elections &amp;amp; Creative Commons&quot;&gt;my quick thinking on the positive developments
regarding CBS releasing democratic
debates&lt;/a&gt;
under a permissive license in the United States has caused
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ferguscassidy.ie/2007/05/08/one-for-everyone-in-the-audience/&quot;&gt;quite&lt;/a&gt;
a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cearta.ie/2007/05/speech-just-wants-to-be-free/&quot;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mulley.net/2007/05/08/first-come-the-parodies/&quot;&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.irishelection.com/05/web-roundup-day-10/&quot;&gt;bloggers&lt;/a&gt; to echo
my call on RTE&amp;rsquo;s stance on releasing the Irish Election 2007 debates. If
you agree we should be allowed to download, remix and share the debates
while giving RTE credit for production, please:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.petitiononline.com/Speech/petition.html&quot; title=&quot;RTE Creative Commons Petition&quot;&gt;Sign the
Petition!&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Poll is now closed as the leaders debates are now finished. It
was not my petition, I would have left it open to deliver to RTE anyway
in respect to other programming for their consideration. Thanks to all
who voted!

      <title>Kerataconus and Me</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/05/06/kerataconus-me/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 May 2007 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/05/06/kerataconus-me</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/KC-lens.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;Well
this is not a technology related post, but I get asked about it alot and
people have sketchy details about what it is (ie. they know my vision is
messed up). &lt;strong&gt;Keratoconus&lt;/strong&gt; (from Greek: &lt;em&gt;kerato-&lt;/em&gt; horn, cornea; and
&lt;em&gt;konos&lt;/em&gt; cone), is a degenerative non-inflammatory disorder of the eye in
which structural changes within the cornea cause it to thin and change
to a more conical shape than its normal gradual curve. In plain English,
light bends in a distorted way to make vision ghosted, blurry and less
sharp. Glasses cannot fix this problem as they fix issues with your
natural lense behind the cornea, as usually it has improper focus.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9a/Keratoconus1-800.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b5/Kc_simulation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully it is a rare disorder, perhaps genetic and it only occurs in
1 out of every 1,000 people or so, I am wearing hard gas permeable
(Oxygen can go through them) lenses which are the biggest pain in the
world to wear, hard pieces of plastic literally sitting on your eye.
This is a short term solution however, as my eyes will continue to
degenerate for the next 20 years or so, then will be most likely
followed by a Cornea transplant (ie. I recieve some other [usually
dead!] persons&amp;rsquo; corneas). There is technology being worked on, such as
slicing the cornea and inserting half a contact lense (literally) in
each side to prop it up. Most likely I am more fortunate then a person
diagnosed with it 10 or 20 years ago, as time is on my side. The reason
I don&amp;rsquo;t talk about it as I don&amp;rsquo;t want it to be a sop story or people to
have pity, it is just a fact of my life, one which I am optimistic of
for the future. Maybe awareness can help raise money for reasearch and
such forth, that would make make me happy. Really my only cause for
concern is this: will computers catch up enough on screen readers and
other disability technology by the time I am blind??!!!! The Wikipedia
article is fantastic, and was my first port of call about it when I
found out I had it:

      <title>Irish Elections and Creative Commons</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This
is the text of an email I sent to RTE. In America, CNN Television
network is allowing the copying, remixing and free use of presidential
debates as long as they are given credit, I believe RTE should follow
its lead and extend to other programs:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;First of all, sorry this isn&amp;rsquo;t to the right department, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t
&amp;gt; find the right one. The technical department which runs the website
&amp;gt; would make likely be able to deal with and respond to this issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; * *&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; * I would like to say thank you for the fantastic RTE.IE live service.
&amp;gt; I am writing this email to ask you follow America&amp;rsquo;s CNN in releasing
&amp;gt; Irish Election broadcasts under a permissive license, like Creative
&amp;gt; Commons. This would allow people to reproduce the content freely, and
&amp;gt; give RTE the credit it deserves. Like Democracy, Culture wants to be
&amp;gt; free and open to the people. This could serve as a trial to Creative
&amp;gt; Commons licensing other RTE produced programs.*&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; * *&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; * Thanks for your time, I look forward to your comments/response on
&amp;gt; this issue!*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll get a response!

      <title>Ultimate Games Disc</title>

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/04/16/ultimate-games-disc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got inspiration over this past Easter holidays, being bored, I gave
Linux Gaming a shot. I am not much of a gamer myself and most websites
aren&amp;rsquo;t very helpful or have too small a focus (only shoot-em-ups, or
only certain Linux distros etc.). Inspired by the fine folks at
OpenSourceMac.org and OpenSourceWindows.org, I announce my own project:
Ultimate Games Disc. UGD is a project I think I can make very
successful. My aims are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Has to be free, either price and/or freedoms. Huge emphasis placed
on Open Source Licenses that conform to the OSI&amp;rsquo;s free software (and
Debian) guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preference on cross platform multiplayer games.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each version should contain mostly the same games, with a few
exceptions, based on quality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There will be three versions, Win, Mac &amp;amp; Linux (Each a DVD-R full)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must have brain-dead easy installers (Mostly a non-issue)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We won&amp;rsquo;t host any software, just do documentation and folder
structure. We then provide a site where people can cherry pick what
they want their UGD to contain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that pretty much sums this project up. It will be organised on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ugd&quot; title=&quot;Ultimate Games Disc&quot;&gt;Launchpad&lt;/a&gt;.
The overall aim is to introduce as many people on as many platforms to
open source gaming!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Apple / EMI Deal - Thank the EU?</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/04/04/apple-emi-deal-thank-eu/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Apr 2007 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/04/04/apple-emi-deal-thank-eu</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I heard the news one
hour before it was announced: Apple and EMI are going Digital Rights
Management (DRM) free, albeit at a slightly higher cost and quality. One
of my pet hates is people who bash the European Union, often citing I
will admit its not glowing charachteristics. These same people never
admit the things &lt;em&gt;Europe does right&lt;/em&gt;, which may well be this hopefully
landslide affect against destroying DRM. To quote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/04/03/apple_emi_ec_fines/&quot; title=&quot;The Register: EMI and Apple Deal&quot;&gt;The
Register&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; In the space of 24 hours Apple has gone from announcing an
&amp;gt; all-singing, all-dancing DRM-free deal with EMI, to facing the
&amp;gt; possibility of being slapped by EU fines of up to 10 per cent of the
&amp;gt; firm&amp;rsquo;s worldwide annual turnover.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; And it is not alone - the major record labels, including EMI, could
&amp;gt; also be hit by the same fines.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; As we reported earlier, the European Commission has issued a Statement
&amp;gt; of Objections &amp;ldquo;against alleged territorial restrictions in online
&amp;gt; music sales to major record companies and Apple&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While although the EU certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t the main motivation, I think that
was profit, but nonetheless it should be given credit for the stick and
carrot treatment of Apple and the record labels. I count the consumer
organisations of Germany, France and the toughest one to Apple: Norway,
as part of the Europe wide effort. Next the EU aims to get rid of
different pricing structure of iTunes Store across the continent, which
like transatlantic air travel, it could literally &amp;lsquo;open up the skies&amp;rsquo;.

      <title>My Top 10 Applications of 2007</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/04/01/applications-of-2007/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a few
items I&amp;rsquo;d like to share with everyone as I find them extremely useful,
hopefully you will too, thats if you have never used them! My Top 10
Apps of 2007 in descending order:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.safer-networking.org/&quot; title=&quot;Spybot Search and Destroy&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spybot Search and
Destroy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
- Always a must on spyware infested Windows XP installs I come across
(Unfortunately all to often). It removes a lot of the bad stuff, and my
most used feature is system startup section, as I can stop all that crud
from loading and slowing everything to a crawl.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/itunes/&quot; title=&quot;iTunes&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;iTunes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (OS X Version)
- Apple&amp;rsquo;s Music player definitely has a nice feel to it, shame about the
copy protection from the iTunes Store. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t really impinge on my
use of it however, I use it to manage my iPods , Podcasts etc. and
occasionally l listen to Internet Radio.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gimp.org/&quot; title=&quot;Gimp Image Editor&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gimp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Ugly as
sin, but useful as anything you&amp;rsquo;ll ever find for free. The Gimp is the
image editor of choice when I do my (admittedly very light) photo
editing. It also cross platform, on Linux, Mac and Windows. While there
are alot of other good free image editors, for all round utility I find
the Gimp has it sewn up.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. **&lt;/strong&gt; ***&lt;a href=&quot;http://earth.google.com/&quot; title=&quot;Google Earth&quot;&gt;Google Earth&lt;/a&gt; *-
Okay Google Earth is pointless for most things, but it is nice to watch
a tour of famous landmarks you have never seen (Eiffel Tower anyone?).
While its utility is perhaps limited, it still provides good fun and a
break from productivity.  &lt;/p&gt;

Desktop&lt;/a&gt; *- Whatgood is any
system if you can&amp;rsquo;t find anything? I have to admit I am a neat freak
when it comes to files on a computer, I have them properly
hierarchically sorted, I only wish I was as organized in real life. But
for those occasional files I misplace, these three utilitys are
invaluable. Spotlight on Mac OS X launches most of my prigrams, Beagle
on Linux is super fast and unobtrusive and on Windows it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get
better than Google Desktop with all those handy widgets for information
blurbs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openoffice.org/&quot; title=&quot;OpenOffice.org&quot;&gt;OpenOffice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; /

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php&quot; title=&quot;Neo Office&quot;&gt;NeoOffice&lt;/a&gt;-
All the suites are free, and they come with great legacy document
handling. I don&amp;rsquo;t use office applications a whole lot for personal use,
but these two I would would pay cold hard cash for, because there that
good. I use Koffice on Linux where possible, due to its improved speed
(as I use KDE Desktop). Koffice will be going multiplatform by the end
of this year, and OpenOffice is working on a native Mac OS X port (a
void which NeoOffice already fills), all in all a good time for free
office suites.** **  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. ** &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://talk.google.com&quot; title=&quot;Google Talk&quot;&gt;Google Talk&lt;/a&gt; *&amp;amp;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adiumx.com/&quot; title=&quot;Adium&quot;&gt;Adium&lt;/a&gt;* - When on Windows, its got to
be Google Talk, even better now that they have a gadget (it&amp;rsquo;s on my
contact page). When I am on my Mac laptop, its got to be Adium. Adium is
the first Open Source application on this list, and for good reason, it
has made beautiful use of GAIM libraries to craft a stunning messenger
application. Linux messengers miss out for a variety of reasons, but
&lt;a href=&quot;http://psi.affinix.com/&quot; title=&quot;Psi Messenger&quot;&gt;Psi&lt;/a&gt; came close to the two
above.&lt;/strong&gt; **  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**3. **&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/&quot; title=&quot;iPhoto&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhoto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - An OS X
only app, it is a beautiful centre-piece to the invaluable iLife suite
from Apple. iPhoto lets me export whole albums as movies (which I then
upload to YouTube), original sized pictures and more. It makes my life
easier so much so, I have stopped photos being put on any other machine
in my home network, they go straight to iPhoto, waiting to get to a
critical mass to be wiped and copied to a DVD and my protable hard
drivr, which iPhoto does in a few clicks. It does it with style als0,
something which Apple is now much lauded for. Although it doesn&amp;rsquo;t come
close to what photography pro&amp;rsquo;s want, it makes my life that much easier,
plus I get all those nice embarrassing ones (of other people) on my iPod
ready to be shown on the move! iMovie missed out as we don&amp;rsquo;t really
video anything important in my household.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/&quot; title=&quot;Nozilla Firefox&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mozilla
Firefox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; -
While it still has quirks as all browsers do, nothing makes me feel as
good about the web as Firefox does. Its myriad of extensions and huge
community which keep it secure is just somethings worth mentioning about
this wonderful browser.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://amarok.kde.org/&quot; title=&quot;Amarok&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amarok&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Without a doubt the
best music manager on the planet. I am amazed at its handling of Digital
Music Players, including iPods. It is lighting fast with a proper
database behind it, so even if you have a large music collection as I
do, it will not go slow or die on you. Its built in music store serves
fresh mp3&amp;rsquo;s, and its onscreen display of songs lets you know what tunes
you&amp;rsquo;re listening to. It has a million and one scripts to make it do
anything, an alarm clock perhaps? done. Tell your friends what your
listening to on your contact list? done. A web interface so you can use
a remote or laptop to control it? done. All of these are a few clicks
away, even for new users it&amp;rsquo;s a breath of fresh air. Visualizers,
faders, any music type you can dream of is playable, I could go on all
night, Amarok has it all and more. Like Koffice it is only really on
Linux (well, Unix-based) at this point, but its development team are
promising OS X and Windows versions. My bet is it&amp;rsquo;ll fly faster off the
shelves than Mozilla Firefox has&amp;hellip;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to follow this up and make a series, I have a lot to say! As I am
know by a lot of people who know me as &amp;ldquo;the&amp;rdquo; Techie person, I plan to
write a few short posts on cleaning up windows, saving space on OSX etc.
and other interesting stuff alot of people ask me questions about.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recorded a tutorial,
showing people how to extract YouTube (and other flash based sites
videos&amp;rsquo;) and get them onto your iPod. It was recorded on my Mac, so
unfortunately its Mac specific, but really only iSquint program is, so
if anyone can suggest a replacement on Windows or Linux, I will add it
to the details of the video. I use Garageband for audio, iMovieHD to
edit the video and audio and Copernicus to record my screen. I started
by getting everything I needed ready (all the Firefox tabs etc.) and hit
record in Copernicus. I imported that .mov into iMovieHD, and then
proceeded to open Garageband, watch the video and talk myself through my
own recording. I saved the voice part in Garageband, exported it and
then imported it into iMovie. I checked to make sure the audio and video
lined up perefectly (what I done on screen matched what I was saying)
and then exported it as a .mov from iMovieHD. Then I uploaded the result
to Youtube, which I think for a first try ain&amp;rsquo;t bad!! Watch it here:  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tor helps Privacy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://img89.imageshack.us/my.php?image=efftorlogo400x282kw9.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Tor Logo&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/3386/efftorlogo400x282kw9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tor
Logo&quot; title=&quot;Tor Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tor,
(or The Onion Router) is a service which connects people all over the
world with one aim: privacy. Tor protects from traffic analysis,
basically where you have been. Benn to you Banks website? Feel like
buying something off Amazon or Ebay? Your behaviour online is by no
means private, you hand over your numerical address, browser details,
country, city, versions of which plugins you use, where you came from,
just to name a few. You may have seen on sites something to the effect
of &amp;ldquo;Welcome Google user!&amp;rdquo;, that website knows exactly what you typed to
get to it. Tor routes your online activity through different computers,
for example mine went through an educational institution in the US and
an Internet Service Provider in the Netherlands.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you want privacy you have something to hide! Not true. You don&amp;rsquo;t
hand over records of everywhere&lt;a href=&quot;http://img207.imageshack.us/my.php?image=torlogost0.png&quot; title=&quot;Tor Logo&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/4282/torlogost0.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tor
Logo&quot; title=&quot;Tor Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
you go in reality, nor documents, or details of medical conditions etc.,
their is a genuine use case for privacy in the modern world which is
sadly being eroded. I just watched ABC news repeat on Sky News, and it
reported of the FBI sending letters out asking for information from
librarys, banks and every institution inbetween. It involved no court,
no checks and balances, nothing. Tor is also used by the law itself, to
conceal government surveillance of illegal activity (for example, child
pornography). So not only is Tor needed, but it can extend to everything
online, Instant Messaging. Tor limits abuse with a high degree of
success and it is cross platform, on Linux, Windows and Mac. Get it

      <title>Open Sourcing your CV</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/03/01/open-sourcing-your-cv/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2007 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/03/01/open-sourcing-your-cv</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just like software. it can be
really useful to open source other things in life, collaboration is
nearly always a good thing. John Buckman, CEO of Magnatune Records knows
this principle all too well. He gave a speech at a Red Hat conference a
while back, and he talked about the importance of music artists sharing
the &amp;ldquo;source&amp;rdquo;, i.e. basically sharing the method of how the produced the
music in the first place. This allows easier mixing, and a higher
chamnce your work could be featured on TV or in a film, and you get paid
- the open source model applied to music.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying this technique with Google Docs and Spreadsheets. Once it
was launched for Google for your domain, I immeadiatley searched for
files to put on it, unfortunately, I had no such luck, all my files were
pdfs! I stumbled across my regular writely account (old Google Docs and
Spreadsheets), and found some files I had forgotten all about. I shared
my CV with some family members, and already I am getting real good
feedback, I wonder what else the open source model ccan be applied to?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this doing a search for Domino
Records DRM. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.riaaradar.com/&quot; title=&quot;RIAA Radar&quot;&gt;looked up some of my favourite
artists&lt;/a&gt; to see if they were
part of the &amp;ldquo;MAFIAA&amp;rdquo; that is the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA&quot; title=&quot;Recording Industry Association of America&quot;&gt;RIAA&lt;/a&gt;
(Recording Industry Association of America), not surprisingly some were
(70% of sold music worldwide is put out by this cartel). I got rather
confused when a Franz Ferdinand album appeared on the list, when their
debut album did not. Seems the record label did a deal with Sony for
distribution. I found a piece of information quite old now (May 2006),
but interesting anyway:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Opponents also challenge the idea that back catalogue revenues
&amp;gt; provide investment for new ventures and to support new artists. Peter
&amp;gt; Jameson of the BPI (British Phonographic Industry) argued in The
&amp;gt; Guardian on 24 April that such investment had contributed to a boom in
&amp;gt; new British music, citing artists such as Arctic Monkeys, James Blunt
&amp;gt; and Kaiser Chiefs. However, Arctic Monkeys are with Domino Records,
&amp;gt; which was founded in 1993 and rarely re-releases records that predate
&amp;gt; itself, and James Blunt was signed by the US label Custard Records,
&amp;gt; which was set up only in 2004 and so has little back catalogue
&amp;gt; material to release; the same is true of Kaiser Chiefs, who are signed
&amp;gt; to B-Unique, which was also founded in 2004. Those are hardly good
&amp;gt; examples of recording companies that rely on significant revenue from
&amp;gt; the back catalogue profits that would be under threat if we were to
&amp;gt; stick at the 50-year copyright term.&amp;rdquo; ( Via &lt;a href=&quot;http://drn.okfn.org/node/124&quot; title=&quot;Quote from Digital Rights Network&quot;&gt;Digital Rights
&amp;gt; Network&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; and associated other sources)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the whole &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management&quot; title=&quot;Digital Rights Management&quot;&gt;Digital Rights
Management&lt;/a&gt;
thing very interesting, will the greedy dinosaurs of the recording
industry win? Or will technologists like &lt;a href=&quot;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1904758034876244745&amp;amp;q=corey+doctorow+drm+microsoft&quot; title=&quot;Corey Doctorows DRM Talk at Microsoft&quot;&gt;Corey
Doctorow&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/&quot; title=&quot;Steve Jobs &quot;&gt;Steve
Jobs&lt;/a&gt;
suceed in getting the point across? After all you don&amp;rsquo;t see many
technologists being record bosses!

      <title>Updates and New look</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2007 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/02/14/updates-and-new-look</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img164.imageshack.us/img164/9038/wordpresslogoxv7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wordpress
Logo&quot; title=&quot;Wordpress Logo&quot; /&gt;Just
a note on the new look, hope you like it. I am very fortunate to be
running
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/&quot; title=&quot;Wordpress Blogging Software&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;, the
world&amp;rsquo;s best blogging tool (and it is open source). I looked up the
fabulous theme site to go with it, and I came across this one and liked
it very much. The last design was my own, but I had awful trouble
implementing to look the same in all browsers (especially Internet
Explorer, even the latest one, argh). I know the old one can be
improved, so I am submitting to &lt;a href=&quot;http://themes.wordpress.net/&quot; title=&quot;Wordpress Themes&quot;&gt;WP Themes
directory&lt;/a&gt;, which I
will update this post with the link. I love the new theme, it brings
what I couldn&amp;rsquo;t to the old one: choosable colours and sameness across
browsers. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank Justin Winslow for that! Did I mention that
the exact same colours are used in this theme? It brings a total
different look though, the power of perception! So now you know these
are the official DF&amp;rsquo;s colours!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further to this, I appreiciate the way posts (on their own page) now
take up the whole page. I don&amp;rsquo;t know about all of you, but I hate
intrusive sidebars. Sidebars in general are a necessary evil (for
navigating the site!), but I am also happy this design is more
&amp;ldquo;ergonomic&amp;rdquo;. I have also added one more adblock, so now the top and
bottom of posts will feature ads by Google. While I don&amp;rsquo;t make a lot of
money at all, every bit goes towards my costs and promotes two software
packages I recommend personally anyway: Firefox and Google Pack. I see
this as a win-win situation, so I hope readers won&amp;rsquo;t mind. The ads in
the sidebar should no longer feature any Microsoft advertisements, as I
have done my best to filter them through the competitive ad filter.
Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s policy on just about (almost) everything is contrary to my
opinion, so I don&amp;rsquo;t feel I should give them exposure. But credit where
credits due, hopefully when I see good things I&amp;rsquo;ll write about it!

      <title>Nokia N800 Review</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/02/11/review/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2007 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/02/11/review</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://img76.imageshack.us/my.php?image=nokian800internettabletdn5.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Hosted Kindly by Imageshack&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img76.imageshack.us/img76/8830/nokian800internettabletdn5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nokia
N800&quot; title=&quot;Nokia N800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I
have one of those new &lt;a href=&quot;http://europe.nokia.com/phones/n800&quot; title=&quot;Nokia N800 Internet Tablet&quot;&gt;Nokia N800 Internet
Tablet&lt;/a&gt;,
as many of you know I was one of the first to buy its predecessor, the
Nokia 770 Internet Tablet. What do I think? Well I have put of writing
this for 4 days, as I wanted to really test it out. Before I start, I
should say I was part of the Nokia Developer Device program, and I got
the Nokia N800 at a big discount, €300 off the €399 retail price in
fact. Under headings below I will take about the N800, and compare it to
the 770:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battery Life:&lt;br /&gt;
This sees an improvement in the N800 alright, as it is meant for
standby. The N770 hadn&amp;rsquo;t got great battery life really at all, so it
seems Nokia payed more attention to the fact it is a communications
device, and like phones it needs the juice for use! I guess part of this
is that they cut out lots of unesscessary stuff from the Linux kernels
boot up, as the device also boots way faster, and has more of a touch a
button and your in business type-of-feel.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ergonomics &amp;amp; Design:&lt;br /&gt;
This is a dissapointment on the N800. It looks nice, all the buttons on
the front are okay, but the ones on top are disastrous. I bet a
marketing person, or a designer who knows nothing (but should) about
ergonomics got a hold of it. It feels like buttons on a phone at the top
of the N800, hunched together as they have no room. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t complain
if I didn&amp;rsquo;t use these so often, but they are used by almost every
program you want to use on the N800! The N770 had much better idea,
spaced out the Zoom (+ &amp;amp; -), fullscreen (on/off) and the power button.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bluetooth:&lt;br /&gt;
Still relatively the same as the N770, yet Nokia have modified software
so that it will accept Bluetooth keyboards, headsets(? Haven&amp;rsquo;t tried)
and other devices officially through the control panel on the device.
This marks a push by Nokia to sell all of these when you are buying the
N800, which is an improvement in my eyes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storage:&lt;br /&gt;
Big improvement here, the N800 not only accepts paltry RS-MMC cards, but
SD amongst others. Not only that but the device has two memory card
slots, each capable of 2GB cards. The N770 recieved critiscism for using
a format not widely in distribution (RS-MMC), so they listened to what
the feedback was. Now its a snap for me to swap in my camera&amp;rsquo;s SD card
and look at those photos on the move!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory:&lt;br /&gt;
Also a huge improvement. The N800 comes with 128mb RAM, and it shows.
Since I have h&lt;a href=&quot;http://img260.imageshack.us/my.php?image=nokian800cd2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Image Kindly Hosted ny Imageshack&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img260.imageshack.us/img260/5447/nokian800cd2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nokia N800 with
Headphones&quot; title=&quot;Nokia N800 with Headphones&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;ad
the device, I had as much as ten windows open (Browser, RSS Reader,
Maemo Mapper, Media Streamer etc) and it ran like as smooth as any
device I have ever used. I guess they are really optimising the software
for the platform, which shows, like in the boot time above. The N770 had
64mb, a slower processor and you felt it. It did what it was supposed
to, but under 4-5 windows it would screech to a halt, not good for a
tablet. You had to resort to memory swapping applications (basically
using the memory card as RAM).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web Browsing &amp;amp; Messaging:&lt;br /&gt;
Web Browsing seems the same as the N770, it mighty be faster, but that
could be due to RAM. A huge dissapointment is no Flash 9, which means no
Youtube or other flash content. Did I mention this is a huge mistake?
People who buy these devices expect their favourite websites to just
work, so a big thumbs down on that front, but hopefully it will be
fixed. Messaging is superb on the N800, and its touchscreen thumb
keyboard is a joy to use. I feel I could type faster on it given enough
time compared to a real keyboard, so this is definately good. I am a big
fan of Google Talk and open standards jabber, so I love the voice
calling part of it. It seems crisp, clear and almost as good as normal
phone. I have tried a video call, and well it is not as good as I
expected. The camera doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem good quality, but it serves ita
purpose. I tried Nokia Video call feature, and well it was also not
good. It dropped voice, video was grainy and the software not on the
N800 was for PC only, not Linux or Mac. I guess this is because Nokia
don&amp;rsquo;t own a messaging service, but I have one piece of advice: don&amp;rsquo;t
bother. Better leave the messaging to people in the know, like Skype.
Although Skype is against everything I believe in (open standards) its
inclusion in the N800 gives better choice, and should be welcomed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal Information Management:&lt;br /&gt;
A big let down I am afraid. Being a Mac user, I expect seamless
integration of contacts and syncing. Maybe Nokia&amp;rsquo;s PC suite works with
the N800, I have&amp;rsquo;t tried. But that said, why doesn&amp;rsquo;t it sync with my
Nokia 6234 phone? With GoogleTalk set to include SIP calling, and Skype
has SkypeOut, I need an easy way to reach all my numbers, to avoid my
mobile phone networks high prices! I don&amp;rsquo;t think they worked on PIM
features since the 770, and it shows. This is fundamental to a
communications device!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the N800 is a nice device and a definate improvement on the
770, but I have a few software and device design issues. I understand
their is limitations in price (what market will accept) and that maybe
Nokia were on a deadline, release something after Christmas to boost
sales which I imagine level off. That said the N800 is not a PDA, or a
phone, so what is it? A tiny laptop? This one I think even confuses
Nokia, but I like it. It makes the Internet Tablet range stand out, and
they mean different things to different people. I give it 7.5/10 which
can rise to a nine if Nokia fix some issues!  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vista is released; Ubuntu gets .exe!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well as
I write this it is a few days after Vista&amp;rsquo;s launch, and it has yet to
set the software market alight. But this is nothing new, it happend with
XP. How do you convince people the latest and greatest is worth the
money? Microsoft is in a tough position due to stiff competition - old,
working, fully-compatible windows machines don&amp;rsquo;t disappear into thin
air. There has been a lot more FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt)abput
Vista already from the Free and Open Source camp. Some of the harsh
critiscims will be justified, others probably not. Regardless this will
not hurt Microsofts marketing whatsoever, the average user doesn&amp;rsquo;t share
concerns over digital restriction/rights management - yet. Microsoft say
it will be on 100m PC&amp;rsquo;s by years end. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it will be as fast
as Microsoft would like, due to: 1) People wait for service packs. 2)
People don&amp;rsquo;t upgrade PC&amp;rsquo;s as fast now. Most things people identify their
computer with is increasingly online, a worrying trend if I were
Microsoft, this creates platform independence for the average user,
granted not the gamers, or other highly specialised software vendors.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu/Debian are working on a Windows installer. This is great news
which I welcome 100%. I think Ubuntu could eclipse Firefox as the
Free/Open Source poster child if it plays it&amp;rsquo;s hand correctly. Top of
the list would be the best migration of settings from Windows possible-
Language, Keyboard, Preferences, Address Book etc. Make this as seamless
and as thoughtless as changing from Internet Explorer to Firefox, and it
is nothing surer to be a huge way of increasing Linux installs. Picture
this: no CD-Recordables to be burnt, no settings to set, 10 minute .exe
click install just like any Windows application and you will see what I
mean. Add to that no partitioning (Ubuntu uses a disk image in Windows),
no modification of Windows file and an Add/Remove option to get rid of
it, and instantaneously you see the appeal, I cannot wait for this
project to be mature, and heres hoping Ubuntu use it for mass
distribution. It can instantly be that cure all for viruses, spyware
etc. we have all come to accept on the windows platform, but why?

      <title>My Plan to Digitise my past, for the future</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/01/30/my-plan-to-digitise-my-past-for-future/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2007 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/01/30/my-plan-to-digitise-my-past-for-future</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am embarking on a journey I believe everyone should:
digitise as much photo, video and documents you can. It serves as a
record of your existance, a guide to people of what your life was like.
Why? is the most obvious question you might ask. Well I will tell you
what prompted me, which is the culmination of a lot of different
things.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the first reason: Television. I find shows fascinating
where people discover their ancestors were orphans, incredibly wealthy
or died from exhaustion in a mine. It really makes you think what makes
you the person you are, so to speak. David Attenborough says (although I
have paraphrased) that if people look back at his 100-150 hours of
television, they will get a snapshot of what the glaciers, mountains,
desert and animals were like in the latter half of the twentieth
century, not a complete picture, but one nonetheless of what Earth was
like at that time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not for other people, do it for yourself is another reason. Memories
are their to cherish and recall. As I try to quantify the future I feel
that if I have any childeren, it will be incredibly weird they have been
missing a whole segment of my life. But no better time has existed to
preserve these memories, in an age where digital devices are commonplace
and cheap. They also are disposable though, so I will have to be careful
to keep my data in a medium that can be read, a challenge in itself. But
I believe I am up to it, and I hope to have every photo, video and
document I have in a digital format sometime in the near future.

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/01/25/bbc-to-host-multi-os-debate-my-first</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img111.imageshack.us/img111/7099/tuxcasefront7rw.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tux, the Linux
Penguin&quot; title=&quot;Tux, the Linux Penguin&quot; /&gt;BBC
are putting together a Mac, Windows and Linux user, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6288119.stm&quot; title=&quot;Mac Linux and Windows Debate&quot;&gt;debate the pros
and cons of being a users for each operating
system&lt;/a&gt;.
While this in itself is good news (more airtime for alternatives), most
of the comments are highly in favour of Linux, then Mac and lastly
Windows. This is part of the BBC&amp;rsquo;s coverage of Windows Vista. My hope
for the future is that Mac and Linux gain at least 10% each (20% total)
over the next 5 years of the home desktop market, as this will push
innovation forward, like AMD and Intel competition.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am selling my first item on auction giant Ebay, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://cgi.ebay.ie/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;amp;rd=1&amp;amp;item=270082923964&amp;amp;ssPageName=STRK:MESE:IT&amp;amp;ih=017&quot; title=&quot;Nokia 770 Ebay auction&quot;&gt;Nokia 770 Internet
Tablet&lt;/a&gt;.
It has served me well, but I recently got a mail the other day that
prompted me to sell my 770. It was Nokia: they informed me since I was
one of the first to purchase the 770 and I was an influential blogger,
they are giving me a lot of money off, and are going to let me have the
n800 for a token sum. Hopefully the auction will go well, I will get the
n800 and have a bit of cash to spare. Not bad as one might say!  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Get the facts, about "Get the Facts"</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/01/21/get-facts-about-get-facts/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2007 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2007/01/21/get-facts-about-get-facts</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick 
blurb about some things Microsoft like to say: Don&amp;rsquo;t believe it, well at
least not it all anyway. On the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/ireland/getthefacts/default.mspx&quot; title=&quot;Irish Get the Facts&quot;&gt;Irish &amp;ldquo;Get the Facts&amp;rdquo;
page&lt;/a&gt;
(on Windows Server vs. Linux), they make critical errors of judgement a
person reasonably well versed in computing could deconstruct. First of
all, Linux isn&amp;rsquo;t a server, its a kernel, like the Windows kernel. So
comparing &amp;ldquo;Windows Server 2003&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Linux&amp;rdquo; is misleading to say the
least, and stupid to say the most. You could run any server software on
Linux you wished, even Windows Server 2003 if Microsoft ported it! For
the sake of argument, I think they are comparing themselves to Apache,
which runs 60% of worldwide
servers&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2007/01/05/january_2007_web_server_survey.html&quot; title=&quot;Netcraft Server Marketshare&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets better though! They use Case Studies to show companies who have
switched. Now what they forget to mention, out of the case studies is
that some of the companies still use and sell Linux solutions to
customers (like Rackspace and GoDaddy)! It took me &amp;lt;15 seconds to search
for these companies on Google and find that out. Please Microsoft, save
some face and release actual independent verifiable data. Fact is I
would not buy off a company who can&amp;rsquo;t even defend and sell its products
properly.

a quick post on Google Sketch UP for Mac (also available for Windows),
it is a very nice application. I drew my Engineering project (Leaving
Certificate) on it, to see if it was easy enough for a novice (Read: Me)
to mess around and get something functional out of it. Most people have
heard of Computer Aided Design, but usually the applications are
expensive to say the least. Not so with Google Sketchup, it is totally
free and can import some of the most popular 3D drawing formats. It is
easy to use, but difficult to master is how I would best describe this
product. The video tutorials Google provides on their website is a huge
help, and got me off to a good start. They represented what every
tutorial should be: short, snappy and to the point. The User Interface
should be designed a little better and be a little clearer, but for a
free product, it does exactly what it says on the tin. So I got down to
business, and I present my very first drawing in Google
Sketchup:&lt;a href=&quot;http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=bb5ff31dbd15ed08cfc639184f913fdf&quot; title=&quot;Engineering Project (c) Neil Grogan 2007, in Google 3D Warehouse&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/1066/epnggg1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Engineering Project (c) Neil Grogan.

I guess you can call me a hardcore &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.ie&quot; title=&quot;Apple Computer&quot;&gt;Apple
Computer&lt;/a&gt; fan, I have a Macbook,
an iPod Nano (1st Gen 4GB) and now a 80GB iPod Video! I bought i for a
couple of reasons, namely price and storage. I had been put off before
since I thought they were too bulky ( I know a couple of people who have
older generation iPod Videos) after being with the Nano for over a year
(its still chugging along gleefully). What can I say? I am impressed!
Battery life is huge to me and well to be frank, its amazing. My first
MP3 player was a Creative Nomad Jukebox II (circa 2002), which I still
have. I know only one person who owned an MP3 player before me, and its
nice to be there from the start, you appreciate the little details most
people don´t, as they are new to mp3 players, so they expect it as
standard. I now get all the latest tech podcasts, so I am very happy
with that!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing is I now have
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freespire.org&quot; title=&quot;freespire&quot;&gt;Freespire&lt;/a&gt;, the Open Source
version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linspire.com&quot; title=&quot;Linspire&quot;&gt;Linspire&lt;/a&gt;. Linspire is a
commercial&lt;img src=&quot;http://img201.imageshack.us/img201/1737/slogoci6.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Freespire Logo (Image Hosted by
ImageShack.us)&quot; title=&quot;Freespire Logo (Image Hosted by ImageShack.us)&quot; /&gt;
Linux distribution, so they include all of the proprietary codecs most
others simply can´t for reasons of cost. Freespire is not up to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com&quot; title=&quot;Ubuntu&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;s standard (not as big pool of
developers/community) and the stable version uses an out-dated
&lt;a href=&quot;http://kde.org&quot; title=&quot;K Desktop Enviroment&quot;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt; and a horrible menu.
Despite this, it has its charm, like click and run, a better
implementation of the APT packaging system (common to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://debian.org&quot; title=&quot;Debian&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;-based distros) and is probably the
easiest distro I have seen to install and run. It don´t have a
partitioner, so it will overwrite Windows (Hey not always a bad thing
;-) ). But setup is easy, and I love the way it brings you to configure
your own settings at one simple screen after an install. My family love
it, and complement it left-right and center! So although Ubuntu is nice
and cleaner (suitable for people new to computers), Freespire definately
wins over the Windows fans!

      <title>Free Domain name off AOL, too good to be true?</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/12/19/free-domain-name-off-aol-too-good-to-be/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2006 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/12/19/free-domain-name-off-aol-too-good-to-be</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aol.com/&quot; title=&quot;AOL&quot;&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt;, the longtime dialup king,
who esperate to keep customers at its&amp;rsquo; site who have switched to
broadband, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://domains.aol.com/personaldomain/app/domainHomeSearch&quot; title=&quot;AOL Free Domains&quot;&gt;offering free dot com and dot net
domains&lt;/a&gt;.
There are a few caches however, one must be in possession of a US mobile
phone (cell) number. Luckily I have a cousin stateside willing to help
out ;-) . I got to register NeilGrogan.com (My actual name) which I
hadn&amp;rsquo;t bothered with before. AOL is the legal owner however, so has all
the say legally to the name. At the minute it provides 100 2GB email
accounts with the free domain, and if you visit the address online, it
redirects to an AIM Pages profile of the owner (for all intents and
purposes, it&amp;rsquo;s another social networking site). Its a good way to drum
up interest in its online offerings, but they should be more flexible.
If anyone is in any doubt, this is just an &amp;lsquo;alright&amp;rsquo; kind of deal, AOL
say they will give you the option to buy the name back in the future,
but I won&amp;rsquo;t hold my breath.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a longtime &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/a/&quot; title=&quot;GAFYD&quot;&gt;Google Apps For your
domain&lt;/a&gt; customer, which like AOL is
totally free. Google however help you to register your own domain (which
is not to far off market price at $10) so you legally own it. Google
offers webspace (Google Pages), email (Gmail), Instant Messaging (Gtalk)
and a start page. If anything AOL have a lot of catching up to do, but
who knows, maybe Google will provide free registration in the future? It
all depends on ad revenues likely garnered from the services they offer.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://domains.live.com/&quot; title=&quot;Windows Live Domains&quot;&gt;Microsoft also offers a similiar
service&lt;/a&gt;, but I have
yet to try it out&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well apparently I am a new kid on the block, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://awards.ie/blogawards/2006/11/27/new-blogs-on-the-block-november-27th-2006/&quot; title=&quot;Irsh Blog Awards&quot;&gt;Irish
Blog awards
blog&lt;/a&gt;.
Irish Blog Awards from what I can gather is a new event, hoping to
happen in March 2007. They have an impressive list of backers, so I
expect significant (although maybe minor) coverage in the media.
Unfortunately they called it Duey Fensters, but I thank them for the
link nonetheless! These are the categories that will be adjudicated on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Blog Post&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most Humorous Post&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Photo Blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Arts and Culture Blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Political Blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Group Blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Personal Blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Use of the Irish Language in a Blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Contribution to the Irish Bloggersphere&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Technology Blog/Blogger&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Designed Blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Sport &amp;amp; Recreation Blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best News/Current Affairs Blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Specialist Blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Newcomer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Business Blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Music Blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Podcast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best Podcaster&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best videocast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well if you think I will fit into any of these categories, let me know.
I&amp;rsquo;ll keep an eye on the event, and update you when the nominating
begins! I think it would be rather cool to win something, anything
really!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently got a hold of my Christmas
present in advance, a new Nokia 6234 from Vodafone Ireland. I did a
short video test, maybe this could be the start of my VideoBlogging
career:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well maybe not! But I do hope to have more videos on my blog! The video
is of me describing my living quarters and about my laptop. I needed to
be a bit closer to the phone as hearing me is difficult sometimes (not
so in real life!), but basically I just point out what you see and
explain the phone won&amp;rsquo;t sync address+calendar with my macbook :-( (My
old phone did just that :-) ). I don&amp;rsquo;t really mind, bluetooth works a
charm and I can exchange files between it. All I need now is a super 2GB
mini memory card, for some quick music on the go!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I managed after ages of trying hard, to
get my NAT transverse to work :-) !! This means the computer sitting in
my house should be reachable worldwide at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://dueyfinster.com/&quot; title=&quot;Duey Finsters Music&quot;&gt;dueyfinster.com&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s
login screen is from Ampache music center, a php+mysql solution to a
large music catalogue such as mine. It means (for those who can login
:-) ) that my whole collection is streamable, downloadable, rateable and
generally all round goodness and what you&amp;rsquo;d expect from a top class open
source media+web application! I am excited about this, as I have already
tried it from a remote family members house. Unfortunately it does not
work too well half way across the world in the US (speed is *really*
slow I have been gleefully informed), but I am not too bothered,
upgrades in speed will come with better broadband (which may be years,
this is Ireland). I am trying to restrict peoples usage of it at the
moment, as I really do not want a letter from my Internet Service
Provider!&lt;br /&gt;
For those interested in hardware, its a cheapo Dell PC I picked up
during the summer for less than €400. I&amp;rsquo;d say I&amp;rsquo;ll get a little more
than a year (If I am lucky) out of it, than I will be asking heavy users
of it to donate for new hardware (likely some weak point in it,
methinks), I just hope I won&amp;rsquo;t be the only heavy user ;-) I also set up
proftpd on it, so I should be able to modify its web directory, and my
home directory on it. Check out my hardware page and see the 2Ghz Dell
for the PC I am on about. As and ever, it runs Kubuntu Linux, and as I
write it chugs away gleefully (for now&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;)

      <title>IEDR too stringent? Sorry about my email!</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/11/19/iedr-too-stringent-sorry-about-my-email/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all want to stop spam and phishing domains, it hurts the
Internet and confidence in it. Their is a lot of debate on this issue,
even from the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bobparsons.com/EULandrushFiasco.html&quot; title=&quot;Bob Parsons Blog&quot;&gt;registrars&lt;/a&gt;.
But I believe, as I know there are probably many out their like me, that
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iedr.ie/&quot; title=&quot;Dot IE Domain Registry&quot;&gt;Irish Domain
Registry&lt;/a&gt; have taken this
one step too far. One only has to look to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/10/14/2142204&quot; title=&quot;Adult .IE Domain Names Banned As Immoral&quot;&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;
to see what the rest of the world thinks about our backwards,
censorship-driven domain registry. My favourite rule they have about
domains is perhaps the one which requires the least amount of
bureaucracy:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Personal names must consist of the initial letter from each of two or
more of the words which comprise the legal personal name of the
applicant, in the order in which these words occur in the name,
followed by any two digits to be requested by the applicant. As an
example, John Citizen could register jc01.ie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is indicative of a backwards registrar that wants you to accept
numbers in your domain, what the hell? I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take the dot ie of
NG89.ie, it seems cheap, like a social networking site. One has to only
look at Technorati and the top Irish bloggers to see IEDR is failing in
its service to the Irish people.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry to all those people trying to email me, I had a bit of trouble
with my DNS settings. It should be all fixed now!  &lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/11/12/wiki-goes-live-downtime-and-macbook</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia Article on Wiki&quot;&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt; at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.dueyfinster.eu/&quot; title=&quot;Duey Finsters Wiki&quot;&gt;wiki.dueyfinster.eu&lt;/a&gt;
for messing about! I haven&amp;rsquo;t found a purpose for it&lt;img src=&quot;http://wiki.dueyfinster.eu/skins/tango/tango-logo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Duey Finsters
Logo&quot; title=&quot;Duey Finsters Logo&quot; /&gt;
yet, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to have it all set up incase one day I turn out to
need it (maybe for collaboration or something?). If you have any skill
at themin&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&quot;htpp://www.mediawiki.org&quot; title=&quot;MediaWiki&quot;&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt; (the most
popular wiki software, run but
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, no less) please,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dueyfinster.eu/about/contact/&quot; title=&quot;Neil Grogan Contact&quot;&gt;please get in
touch!&lt;/a&gt;
I would do it all myself, but my time is constrained at the moment, but
I will eventually do it myself I suppose ;-)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you may have noticed downtime lately, that&amp;rsquo;s because of the
wordpress.com domains add-on is a shambles, at least for dot-eu anyhoo.
Support tried to be helpful, and to be fair it was a new feature, but I
wasted $10 (about €7.50) for nothing, as I couldn&amp;rsquo;t use dueyfinster.eu
with it. Half of it was perhaps my fault, as I couldn&amp;rsquo;t use MX records
(for redirecting mail requests) to my
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/a/&quot; title=&quot;Google for your Domain&quot;&gt;GFYD&lt;/a&gt; so I tried to
add more nameservers, having the first pointing at Wordpress.com and the
rest pointing at Google. Needless to say after to-ing and fro-ing I
decided to keep my self hosted solution, as it offers total control
(such as my own template, javascript, etc.). That is why the site was
down, it kept resolving at different locations :-(&lt;br /&gt;
I got the Macbook back from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mactivate.ie&quot; title=&quot;Mactivate&quot;&gt;Mactivate&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a new
logic board (aka. the PMU I often and painfully referred to in my
earlier posts). I had a bit of a scare though, as less than two hours
after I got it back, the Macbook would only show the LED light when I
tryed to power it on. I was worried I&amp;rsquo;d face at least another two weeks
away from my laptop! I saw another Apple knowledge base article,
describing it could be the RAM unseated. I popped off the battery, only
to see the smallest phillips head screws you could imagine. It took me
well over a day to find a jewellers screwdriver (luckily a relative of
mine had one :-) ). I guess Apple do this, so it is awkward to buy RAM
from others. To my hope of all hopes, I popped the RAM out and in, and
hey presto it works! I have not had a problem since (fingers crossed).
Writing this post from it now by the way&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looks like
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mactivate.ie/&quot;&gt;Mactivate&lt;/a&gt; got it wrong, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/moria/252792233/&quot; title=&quot;Macbook Black&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/111/252792233_4d87e73e02_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Macbook
Black&quot; title=&quot;Macbook Black&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;it
wasn&amp;rsquo;t the heatsink, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dueyfinster.eu/2006/11/01/macbook-issue-identified/&quot;&gt;as referred to by my earlier
post&lt;/a&gt;.
Looks like I have seen good advice from the Web, never buy a first
generation &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; product, until they work out
the kinks! I guess Mactivate have been snowed under with heatsink
problems, that they never bothered to check other parts of my Macbook,
since it is such a common
problem.[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/moria/252792233/)They have
ordered me a new &amp;ldquo;logic board&amp;rdquo; (I am guessing the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303319&quot;&gt;PMU&lt;/a&gt; like I
thought it was ;-) ). In other news &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macfixit.com/article.php/2006110107475681#&quot;&gt;Apple released a firmware
update&lt;/a&gt; for those
poor unfortunates that have been suffering &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macbookrandomshutdown.com/&quot;&gt;Random Shutdown
Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (or
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; for short :-D ).
Hopefully I should have it back by this Tuesday (November 7th) plus a
new heatsink and logic board&amp;hellip;. fingers crossed anyway!

      <title>Macbook Issue Identified</title>

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/11/01/macbook-issue-identified</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Turns out my prediction
wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite correct, it was not the Power Management Unit
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303319&quot;&gt;PMU&lt;/a&gt;), it was
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macbookrandomshutdown.com/&quot;&gt;heatsink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.apple.com/macbook/images/macbookglossydisplay20060516.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MacBook
Black&quot; title=&quot;MacBook Black&quot; /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mactivate.ie/&quot;&gt;Mactivate&lt;/a&gt; have informed me they have one on
order from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.ie/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, so it will take a bit longer
than I anticipated to get my
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html&quot;&gt;Macbook&lt;/a&gt; back. I found this
strange as I had not experienced random shutdowns like the ones that
have been widely reported across the web. it was like I described in my
earlier post, something to do with the battery not being able to charge.
Then again, I am no expert on this and their is wide evidence (over 1600
people have identified heatsink as a problem in their Macbooks) that the
heatsink is a definite issue. Sounds like good or bad I will have a lot
more to say about Apple Computer in the future, thats why I have decided
to add them as a category.

      <title>Internet Explorer thanks Firefox, sincerely?</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/10/26/internet-explorer-thanks-firefox/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2006 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/10/26/internet-explorer-thanks-firefox</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading on my favourite tech news site. Slashdot (
&lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/articles/06/10/26/1238239.shtml&quot;&gt;/.&lt;/a&gt; ), I see the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/&quot;&gt;Internet Explorer team&lt;/a&gt; have sent the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://getfirefox.com/&quot;&gt;Firefox Team&lt;/a&gt; a nice cake:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/118/278562314_14716c0232.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MS IE Cake for Firefox
2&quot; /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One comment I read said it all really:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Seems even the IE team knows that IE is dead.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; As for the ex-lax, bugs, pubes in the cake of course none of that is
&amp;gt; true. Those things would only be possible if someone at Microsoft
&amp;gt; actually made the cake, and that&amp;rsquo;s not how MS does things. They knew
&amp;gt; they couldn&amp;rsquo;t make a good cake so they just went out and bought a cake
&amp;gt; from someone who already knew how to make one and then stuck their
&amp;gt; logo on it and called it theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is of course just lighthearted banter, but on a serious note, many
Internet Explorer developers have Firefox to thank for a job. Microsoft
disbanded the Internet Explorer team after version 6 and had no plans to
make version 7 until Firefox blazed a trail, irony or what? Here&amp;rsquo;s to
many years of competition between Firefox, Internet Explorer (on
whatever platform!), Opera, Safari, Konqueror and the rest!

      <title>Blog Updates, Calendar Updates, broken Macbook</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/10/25/blog-updates-calendar-updates-broken/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2006 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/10/25/blog-updates-calendar-updates-broken</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well first of all, there has been some blog updates, inspired
no less by my Grandfather! He&amp;rsquo;s at a fragile old age, so he can&amp;rsquo;t read
the screen all too well. This is not a problem however, as he sets all
fonts to 16 and higher in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getfirefox.com/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; (which
is out of beta and into version 2.0!). That got me thinking, as I really
struggled to read this page being marginally away from the screen, as I
am a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus&quot;&gt;Keratoconus&lt;/a&gt; sufferer.
As a result, I have enlarged all fonts in my blog, in an effort to make
them more readable&amp;hellip; I encourage everyone to do the same, or at least
follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3c.org/&quot;&gt;web standards&lt;/a&gt; so that it can be
properly auto resized by browsers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I have updated my Calendar for well into 2007! All the dates I can
forsee have been duly added and accounted for. Please consult to it and
collaborate (if you have a google account, you can add appointments,
invite me to yours etc.) I use it all the time (especially as I have
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/isync/&quot;&gt;iSync&lt;/a&gt;, which syncs it to
my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nokia.ie/web/product_details?productId=220&quot;&gt;Nokia 6021&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html&quot;&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; through
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/itunes/&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;.) Google now sends me an
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_message_service&quot;&gt;SMS&lt;/a&gt; (although it
costs standard rate [13c per message for me] :-( ) two days before every
appointment as a friendly reminder.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the title reads, my Macbook was well and truly borked, well at least
the charging function is. I rang &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, which
were more helpful than I expected. They offered to send me a replacement
charger, which I offered to take, but the operator agreed with my
assesment that it was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303319&quot;&gt;Power Management
Unit&lt;/a&gt;, and that
another AC adaptor would not cut it. I have since taken it to an Apple
service center, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mactivate.ie/&quot;&gt;Mactivate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.co.uk/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=18&amp;amp;ll=53.410331,-6.35698&amp;amp;spn=0.002094,0.005032&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;om=1&quot;&gt;which is
in Blanchardstown in
Dublin&lt;/a&gt;
(right by the ugly water tower near &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dublin-airport.com/&quot;&gt;Dublin
airport&lt;/a&gt; while driving on the M50). Also
just a quick footnote, but I recently read of spammers hiring people in
the third wirld to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha&quot;&gt;capthcas&lt;/a&gt;
(like ones I use) and post
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(electronic)&quot;&gt;spam&lt;/a&gt;. It seems I may
have been affected by this, luckily it was still filtered by
&lt;a href=&quot;http://akismet.com/&quot;&gt;akismet&lt;/a&gt;!! muhahahahaha

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Ladies and Gents, needs no introduction, for you all know George W.
&amp;ldquo;Dubya&amp;rdquo; Bush. What you may not know is the Daily Show, which is a
popular news satire show in the US. If you have time I recommend you
have a look on YouTube for more videos&amp;hellip;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also check out the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dueyfinster.eu/about/calendar&quot;&gt;Google Gadgets
Calendar&lt;/a&gt;, which is 10x more
nifty than that awful Iframe calendar I had before!

      <title>Google buy YouTube, GTalk for everyone and Blogger Bliss</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/10/10/google-buy-youtube-gtalk-for-everyone/</link>

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/10/10/google-buy-youtube-gtalk-for-everyone</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted in a while :-( Ah well
here it goes: Well we&amp;rsquo;ve all seen the news Google has bought YouTube for
a reported 1.65 Billion US dollars, the deal was reportedly sealed at at
Dennys in California (gotta admire that style and sophistication). I
think its way overvalued Youtube, at 24m per employee! We all know it
serves 100m videos a day, but it has been living off measly venture
capital and hasn&amp;rsquo;t got a verifiable steady income stream, which I guess
is where Google enter with Adwords&amp;hellip;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gtalk has now opened up to everyone with an email address, this is great
news for Jabber. While yourname@jabber.org was okay, people prefer to
have one unified address (well I do) for email and instant messaging.
Also comes news of deal with Skype, and old news of AOL joining their IM
services with Google Talk. This is great for the Jabber Platform, and
should halp fight competition from the recent Yahoo-MSN messenger tie
up, hooray for open standards!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am seriously thinking of moving this blog to blogger, and migrating
from (the wonderful) wordpress. I want to do this of reasons of cost
(for one, I pay hosting) and I want to trial hosting it myself, with
Blogger as a backup. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will ever get slashdotted now, but
it always helps to have as robust of a network as Google does behind
you. That is the reason I use Google hosted, it is reliable and
dependable , not to mention feature-rich.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to quickly metion Firefox 2, which is in beta stage at
the moment. I am writing the blog post on my MacBook through it, and the
spell checker is smething quite special (It has a red line under that
purposeful spelling error as I type, rather useful!). Anyways, I hope to
post more often and soon&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/08/16/macbook-update-fonero-haven-commercial</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have ordered and I am expecting
delivery of my brand new Apple MacBook (or BlackBook&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.apple.com/macbook/images/macbookglossydisplay20060516.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MacBook
Black&quot; title=&quot;MacBook Black&quot; /&gt;
as some call it)! It will be a Black, 2Ghz Core Duo, 1 GB RAM, 120 GB
HDD (5400 RPM) MacBook, complete with a remote, Bluetooth 2 and Wifi
functionality. Not mention cool applications such as iSight built in
Camera, Front Row ( a media center) and Spotlight search technology. It
cost me close to €2.000, so hopefully it will be worth it ;-)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also joined, for a month, a commercial darknet. Don&amp;rsquo;t know what
that is? It is basically me paying for an extra layer of security,
128-bit encryption to a Swedish Internet service provider. Why? Well
that means that if my ISP ever got a court order from a company, they
would not have any records on me, since it will be encrypted, leaving
them with no trace of what I have been upto. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong I am a
totally law abiding person, and the law says I have a right to privacy.
I am just enforcing that right, in case my ISP was collecting anything
(BT is my ISP), like my passwords. I also share my connection through my
FON router, so as I will be using VPN encrypted network, I can prove
100% it wasn&amp;rsquo;t me who abused my internet connection, clearing me of
liability. &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060815-7502.html&quot; title=&quot;Swedish Commercial Darknet&quot;&gt;Ars
Technica&lt;/a&gt;
*(&amp;ldquo;[The] Technical Art in Latin&amp;rdquo;) *&lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060815-7502.html&quot; title=&quot;Swedish Commercial Darknet&quot;&gt;has an interesting article on the
matter&lt;/a&gt;.
That said, I have heard little of file sharing implications in Irish
Law.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I am one of the newest members of the FON community Wifi project.
What the hell is this I hear you ask? Basically you share your internet
connection, either for free (like I do)or for a small fee to others. If
you share yours for free, you get free access to other FON routers
worldwide. If however you &amp;ldquo;milk your wifi&amp;rdquo; (aka. make people pay) you
hve to pay to use other foneros[sic] routers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see Leaving Cert results are out today! I am not looking forward to
the year ahead, my last year of secondary school, 6th Year. I will be
sitting the Leaving Cert next June, and well to say its no easy task to
do well would be an understatement! I do Physics, German, Engineering,
Irish, English, Maths, Geography which all will be tested! I wish
everyone who has done it, the very best of luck this year, and I hope
they all get the results they want. Each of your six best subjects is
picked, all weighted on points and automatically submitted to the
Central Applications office which holds a list of predetermined points
on courses in registered institutions. Based on the availabilty (read
&amp;ldquo;supply and demand&amp;rdquo;) is whether you get the course, as points fluctuate.
They have rounds of offers, until all places are filled. No idea what I
want to do, but I am looking in the sub &amp;lt;350 points range, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be
too hard to achieve!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel I need to confess why I am buying a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/uk/macbook/macbook.html&quot; title=&quot;MacBook&quot;&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt;, have
I turned soft to
my[](http://www.opensource.org/ &amp;ldquo;|Open Source&amp;rdquo;)&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensource.org/&quot; title=&quot;|Open Source&quot;&gt;Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/68/183098632_e21e6230e2_t.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;July

095/365&quot; /&gt; Source/
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fsf.org/&quot; title=&quot;Free Software Foundation&quot;&gt;Free Software&lt;/a&gt; ways?
No, definately 100% NOT. I’ll explain why: I think Apple Computer has an
incredible product in Mac OSx. For anyone who has not used it before,
pop into a 3G store and ask to have a go. When someone releases a good a
product as that, they deserve money, in my opinion. Under “the” free
software license (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt&quot; title=&quot;GNU General Public License&quot;&gt;GNU General Public
License&lt;/a&gt;)
it is permissable for anyone to charge for software licensed under it,
as long as an offer of source code is given (for 3 years afterwards).
Deep down I love &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntulinux.org/&quot; title=&quot;Ubuntu Linux&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;,
and I will install it as soon as possible when they release a version
for the Intel powered Apple computers. In fact I will use my Laptop to
showcase Ubuntu!If you had of told me November last year I’d spend well
over €1,000 on an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot; title=&quot;Apple Computer&quot;&gt;Apple
Computer&lt;/a&gt;, I would have told you
that I hated Apple, and would never consider it! What has changed my
mind? I got a iPod Nano for Christmas ‘05 and thought it was great, but
the Nano on its own still wouldn’t convince me to get a Mac. I was
always going to buy a laptop this year, but the turning point was me
using Mac OSX on a computer in work, that sold it itself. Don’t get me
wrong, I still despise Apple for their copy protection (why can’t I play
songs I bought on non-Apple mp3 players? Its Anti-competitive!) on songs
bought on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/itunes/&quot; title=&quot;iTunes&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, but I feel
this was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.riaa.com/&quot; title=&quot;Record Industry Association of America is Evil&quot;&gt;forced by the record
companies&lt;/a&gt;,
it just had a nice side affect for Apple to lock people to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ipod/&quot; title=&quot;Apple iPod&quot;&gt;iPods&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X&quot; title=&quot;Mac OS X&quot;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opendarwin.org/&quot; title=&quot;Open Darwin&quot;&gt;is built
on top of Open Source&lt;/a&gt;, partly
the reason for it being so good! So in reality, instead of me paying for
lets say RedHat, Suse or Linspire (all Linux) with proprietary drivers
and an open source kernel, I am buying into Mac OS X which also has an
open source kernel, but with more proprietary applications. Also I have
Ubuntu on my two desktops, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://europe.nokia.com/770&quot; title=&quot;Nokia 770&quot;&gt;Nokia
770&lt;/a&gt; runs
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kernel.org/&quot; title=&quot;Linux Kernel&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and I do not use Windows
whatsoever. So I am still as big of a Free and Open Source FanBoi as I
ever was, perhaps even more, hey your talking to a guy who plays &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vorbis.com/&quot; title=&quot;Ogg Vorbis is a completely open, patent-free, professional audio encoding and streaming technology with all the benefits of Open Source.&quot;&gt;Ogg

      <title>Law and the Interweb</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/08/02/law-and-interweb/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Aug 2006 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/08/02/law-and-interweb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am writing this because, I regret to say, the stupidity of humanity.
People nowadays&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/nyghtowl/24796154/&quot; title=&quot;photo sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/23/24796154_e329f8d0a0_t.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lady
Justice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
define their own law on the Web and the Internet (don’t know the
difference, you should), while disregarding real life. Maybe its a lack
of understanding about technology or law, I don’t know. One things for
sure, common sense can go a long way. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecommitments.net/&quot; title=&quot;The Commitments Official Website&quot;&gt;Take for example this website on
the
Commitments&lt;/a&gt;,
which prohibits linking from unauthorised sites! You see? I just broke
the law right there, amazing dontcha think? The person who designed or
put the statement up, is a total complete and utter idiot, and I don’t
care if thats considered slander! Imagine if every site was to do this?
Search engines would be just another litagation filled business, like so
many other. With Lawyers reviewing every site to go into the database,
Google would have a handful, maybe a 100 sites, instead of the usual
billions it indexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stupidity isn’t only defined to obscure bands from movies, it also
happens at Reuters, the big multinational news site. In their
conditions, it says you may not cache any part of the story on their
website. For those not in the know, caching is storing a site
temporarily (usually) for viewing later, or to increase load times on
often visited webpages (eg. Googles Logo). Only one problem with this:
every browser for more than a decade has done just this, are we all
breaking the law? Also Google, Yahoo! and MSN have vast caches of sites,
incase it is temporarily down while you visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is this: When people claim to know about Law and/or the
interweb, please check facts first, and be very careful while doing so.
Just because the internet “technically” has no law (standardised one
anyway), doesn’t mean black is the new white, quote sources, state laws
and reasearch wether your mumbo jumbo violates their rights, also state
which country your site is hosted and where complaints can be made. This
should be standard practice! /endrant&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7231752728434532377-2571531371818222670?l=neil.grogan.ie&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Design, Ranking, Gmail Hosted, OS 2006 Finale and YouOS</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/07/12/new-design-ranking-gmail-hosted-os-2006/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hope you like the new look Duey Finsters. Like Google style hoo-pah, we
are still in “Beta” mode (or is it “Alpha”? Depends on who you ask!). I
would be extremely grateful for people to report issues, with the
folloxing browsers IE 5.5, 6 &amp;amp; 7, Opera 9, Firefox 1.5.X , Mozilla 1.X ,
Safari on all platforms Windows, Linux and Mac (BSD if you want!). Great
news also in ranking, the site has gone from 8.5 millionth, to just
under 4 million (#3,945,836 to be exact) in three and a half months! I
am working on releasing the design to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oswd.org/&quot;&gt;OSWD&lt;/a&gt; and
in Wordpress theme format, for others to extend and enjoy (If you feel
like helping out, contact me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest Nokia 2006 tablet edition has just been released , I have yet
to Flash my device, but I hope its good. The Beta lived up to its name,
it was buggy. It has only been just over a month since that release, so
I hope they fixed vast majority of the bugs, but to me it seems its
rushed. This would go against Nokia’s ethos of quality software (you
only have to look at Symbian, rock solid).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Beta’s, I got Gmail hosted recently. It is not much
different than normal Gmail, in fact it lags behind in the feature list
of actual Gmail. For one it does not use pictures of contacts and is not
linked to a Google account. I suspect that is intentional, to woo
customers knowing that they won’t be fiddling with Googles latest toy. I
had Spreadsheets on my Gmail account, but on hosted I could not use it,
as I did not have a “Gmail” account. Same thing when I tryed Picasa
Photo Albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently came across a fascinating website, one called YouOS (
www.youos.com). It is a virtual desktop which is 100% online. Although,
it is the first of its kind, so don’t expect everything. Its features
are impressive for the limitations of a website and it takes on a
familiar look, that in the form of the GNOME Desktop. Check it out if
you have time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7231752728434532377-2984790835743381567?l=neil.grogan.ie&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my letter to U.S. Dept. of
Commerce, stating what I believe should happen to the Internet. Fell
free to email your opinions to them directly: *
&lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#068;&amp;#078;&amp;#083;&amp;#084;&amp;#114;&amp;#097;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#105;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#064;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#105;&amp;#097;&amp;#046;&amp;#100;&amp;#111;&amp;#099;&amp;#046;&amp;#103;&amp;#111;&amp;#118;&quot;&gt;&amp;#068;&amp;#078;&amp;#083;&amp;#084;&amp;#114;&amp;#097;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#105;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#064;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#105;&amp;#097;&amp;#046;&amp;#100;&amp;#111;&amp;#099;&amp;#046;&amp;#103;&amp;#111;&amp;#118;&lt;/a&gt;*. As a
net citizen, get your voice heard on the most important public debate of
our times!&lt;br /&gt;
Dear Sir/Madam,&lt;br /&gt;
I, as a citizen of Ireland and the EU, think with respect, the Internet
should have a world governing body, fairly appointed by each country who
has more than 30% of their respective populations online. For those
under 30% they should get to have a sub-committee, to prioritise and
promote the Internet in their countries. I think while although ICANN
has generally not been a bad governing body, vast improvements can be
made, such as not allowing pressure from companies to increase domain
prices, when the cost of providing them has come down dramatically over
the past few years. I do recognise, that the Internet was partially
created with the help of U.S. government funding, but this comes from
the people of America, who would want the Internet to be a force for
change, like for example, the way it is helping Chinese dissidents.Also,
as with all US government generated ideas, it is free from patent and
copyright which applies worldwide, such as NASA images, for example.
This should be true of the Internet also, as it is with GPS (which I use
regularly, Thanks for that!). I am not a whole believer in the U.N.
however, I think the Internet governing body should be free form all
Government and International organisational pressures (but not those
that seek to limit abuse, such as child pornography, obviously). I thank
you for offering a public debate on this issue and I sincerely hope the
outcome will be of benefit to everyone living on earth.&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Questions, Hosting and IT 2006!</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/06/23/questions-hosting-and-it-2006/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2006 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/06/23/questions-hosting-and-it-2006</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently
found a great documentary, about 9/11, entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8260059923762628848&quot; title=&quot;911 Loose Change 2nd Edition with extra footage&quot;&gt;Loose Change
9/11&lt;/a&gt;“.
It is easily the most powerful about the event, much more so than
Fahrenheit 9/11. In fact I would even argue, that if this documentary
had of aired during the U.S. presedential election, I would have bet on
a different result. Backed up by trusted resources such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1559151.stm&quot; title=&quot;BBC which confirmed at least 8 of the 19 highjackers are alive and well&quot;&gt;BBC
which confirmed at least 8 of the 19 highjackers are alive and
well&lt;/a&gt;.
Filled with outrageous facts, it sets the scene for either a highly
competent Bush regime that new what it was doing, or the worst domestic
tragedy that happend under maladministration. Either way the American
people have serious questions to ask, which I hope in time will get the
aired in time. Maybe George W. is taking a leaf out of Charlie Haugheys
book? That is that corruption can be a force for the good of the public,
and my rich friends?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I would like to unreservedly apologize that this site has been down
for so long. The thing is my ex-hosting provider, which I won’t even
honor with a link, was an incompetent mess. I have now moved to an Irish
company, Hosting365.ie, which gives me freephone support all for a
little extra money. Also their premises is in Dublin, which means I can
call in at any time and I get the protection of Irish Law (even though
we know its a mess [e.g. Mr.A child abuser being set free], I still
think we have an alright civil liberties protection, even though I know
nothing about law, so I am most likely misguided, anyhoo!) of course not
without paying the 21% VAT, which needs to be lowered might I add.&lt;br /&gt;
This isn’t my usual tech babble I know, but I’ll end this post with the
news that I am BETA testing the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet Edition 2006
[maemo.org]. It rocks so hard, I can’t even begin to say…… First of
theirs GoogleTalk built in, with support for SIP (might be from Gizmo).
Notwithstanding that, their are cool native applications such as
MaemoPad Plus [Sketch/Notes] and MaemoMapper [GPS+ Google Maps]. Somehow
they have squeezed more battery life out of this gadget, and now you can
create a swap on the memory card, meaning its, I’d say (pure
speculation, obviously) 80% more efficient. Warning to people who
actually use the 770 for important stuff, don’t upgrade until Nokia has
released it, as it is very buggy, with applications crashing [somewhat]
alot. Wait until all of us in the know, report those pesky bugs! But a
real geek can see through the flaws and see the Nokia 770 for what it
is, a truly cool Internet tool.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I regularly read other
Irish blogs to see whats happening and whats the latest tech thing&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dueyfinster.eu/license/fairuse&quot; title=&quot;Fair Use&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://es.fon.com/images/fon-logo-250.png&quot; alt=&quot;FON
Logo&quot; title=&quot;FON Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
amongst others. It seems that may have come to fruition, with FON, a
community wifi project, sending me out a free router!! I am exicted
about this, as I hope to convince all my neighbours eventually to get
it, and maybe who knows, I may even achieve the biggest fon hotspot, if
I take my campaign estate wide, to neighbours all around! I want to “eat
my own dog food” as they say, so I will wait until I have recieved and
used my router before I recommend it to non-technical people. I have
read of long delays on FON’s forums, so I expect iot should be here
within two to three weeks, maybe a little longer. Also it comes with a
european plug, not a Irish/British one, which is a bit of a
disappointment that I will have to root out the screwdriver to make it
fit!!!&lt;br /&gt;
Also, I was recently employed by the Irish National Lottery contractors,
GTECH Ireland Operations, part of GTECH Corporation (who trade as
&lt;strong&gt;GTK&lt;/strong&gt; on New York Stock Exchange). It was voted one of the fifty best
places to work last year. I am very exicited at the prospect, as I will
gain many insights on the life of working. They own a number of
franchise lotterys around the world, including the United Kingdom,
Portugal and Spain.&lt;br /&gt;
I also, as part of my new job, join the Dublin commute. Iarnrod Eireann,
while after&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dueyfinster.eu/license/fairuse&quot; title=&quot;Fair Use&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.irishrail.ie/images/ie_logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Irish
Rail&quot; title=&quot;Irish Rail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
coming on in recent years is a fine company, I still believe it has a
long way to go. The lack of a cheap, clean and friendly transport system
does hurt Dublin in terms of tourism and business, of that I have no
doubt. I was recently in Rome, which you get 75 minutes unlimited travel
on the bus, plus one metro journey, all for, get this, €1! Yes you read
that correctly €1! Why can’t we do this? I think we can, but we need an
integrated transport system first. How come after all these years you
still cannot get a ticket for Bus, Train and Luas in one? Thats what
baffles me the most, and it could make a huge difference, one ticket! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;

      <title>Nuclear or Nothing?</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/05/11/nuclear-or-nothing/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2006 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/05/11/nuclear-or-nothing</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/56/138071833_708a52b884.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nuclear Shelter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ireland we, like the rest of the world, have though questions to
answer. Ireland being an island economy, is especially reliant on oil,
none of which we produce. I was surprised earlier this week to hear one
of George W. Bush’s top aides, saying that the U.S. needs to lose
dependence on foreign oil and research alternatives. I was never more
shocked, to hear Bush’s change of heart, from using improved technology,
to one of his aides saying they need to use less oil. Part of me was
angry, as he defiantly rejected Kyoto agreement, when the United States
produces 25+% of all greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we get to the question of Nuclear power, which has been controversial
in Ireland, but not continental Europe for years. We all know about
Chernobyl, and its harrowing effects on the world. But we also cannot
cut off our hand to spite our face, should we ban footballs because they
hurt people? or Cars because people get killed? The reality is, Cars
have killed more people throughout history, than all nuclear incidents
combined (50,000 every year in the U.S. alone). The reality is also
this, within 100 miles of Dublin (Ireland’s Capital), there at least 10
nuclear plants, within 1,000 miles, this rises to over 100 nuclear
plants. France generates over 70% of its power through Nuclear power,
whilst the U.K. generates 25%. We cannot produce enough power in
Ireland, so we buy power from the United Kingdom, being in direct
benefit of that 25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody I have spoken to, around my age, have nearly all said the
exact same thing, we will have to use nuclear power, whether we like it
or not. If one of those plants were to suffer a meltdown, it is
unavoidable that we will suffer, so why not benefit from Nuclear power
while we can? People will bring up Chernobyl, but the fact is, plants
like Chernobyl are old soviet technology, which is no longer used and
was designed when we were naive about nuclar power. Also radiation
effects are most damging to humans, whilst &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4923342.stm&quot;&gt;animals are starting to
return to Chernobyl&lt;/a&gt;. The
Ukraine is commissioning more and more nuclear plants, and it was one of
the worst affected areas of the whole disaster. Nuclear Power : We
cannot afford to live without it, even one of the founders of
Greenpeace, one of the most militant enviromentalist groups, now accepts
this. The Internet literally &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/trends?q=Nuclear+Power,+Renewable+Energy&amp;amp;ctab=0&amp;amp;geo=all&amp;amp;date=all&quot; title=&quot;Nuclear VS. Renewable Energy&quot;&gt;buzzes with Nuclear news and developments,
compared to
renewab&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Best Radio Podcasts</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/05/02/best-radio-podcasts/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2006 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/05/02/best-radio-podcasts</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even while podcasts are relatively new (well a couple of years - like
blogs), Irish Radio Stations are surprisingly well in on the act. Even
our incumbent state broadcaster, RTE, is podcasting en-masse on both RTE
Radio 1 and RTE 2FM. To recieve podcasts, you need podcasting software,
start by getting &lt;a href=&quot;http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/index.php&quot;&gt;Juice
Reciever&lt;/a&gt;(Formerly
iPodder), available for Linux, BSD, MAC and Windows. I will start with
my top 5 Irish Radio podcasts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audio.todayfm.com/lwpodcasting.xml&quot;&gt;Matt Cooper’s The Last
Word&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.todayfm.com/&quot;&gt;Today
FM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rte.ie/2fm/podcast/podcast_gerryryan.xml&quot;&gt;The Weekly Ryan, Gerry
Ryan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rte.ie/2fm/&quot;&gt;RTE
2FM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newstalk106.ie/podcasts/Breakfast.xml&quot;&gt;Breakfast Show with Eamon
Dunphy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newstalk106.ie/&quot;&gt;NewsTalk
106&lt;/a&gt; (Dublin-Based)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rte.ie/2fm/thesaturdayshow.html&quot;&gt;The Saturday Show&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rte.ie/2fm/&quot;&gt;RTE 2FM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rte.ie/rams/radio/latest/rte-thetubridyshow.smil&quot;&gt;The Tubridy
Show&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rte.ie/radio1/&quot;&gt;RTE Radio 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for my Top Technology Related Podcasts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lugradio.org/episodes.rss&quot;&gt;Lug Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/downloadtrial/worldservice/digitalplanet/rss.xml&quot;&gt;BBC Digital
Planet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://revision3.com/diggnation/feed/high.mp3.xml&quot;&gt;Diggnation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, all of the above are free, some even are advertising
free (Lug Radio, Digital Planet, Ryan Weekly).This is not a definitive
list, only a select few popular ones that I myself listen to. If you
want to suggest more, go ahead, tell me whats the best podcasts in your
area, I would be interested to know! In the meantime, hours of listening
lies ahead of you, mp3 players at the ready. Also almost all are update
continually, so more to listen to every day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7231752728434532377-5707048351740258057?l=neil.grogan.ie&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spam, will it ever stop?</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/04/29/spam-will-it-ever-stop/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2006 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/04/29/spam-will-it-ever-stop</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/54/136808455_58aae5f13d_t.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CAN Spam&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spam has become a fact of life nowadays, but is their anything we can do
to stop it? The answers boils down to no, we can’t. If we make it
illegal, the spamsters move abroad or go underground, as we have seen in
the United States. People have been prosecuted, but again this does not
deter people. Spamhaus have a novel idea, by trusting domains on
reputation, based on spam reports. But this has one fatal flaw, it
involves people reporting spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation is not as bad if you use Gmail, that is Google Mail. For
over a year and a half,I got spam, but it was properly sorted and easily
deletable. Before that I used Yahoo Mail, which like Hotmail before
that, would mark items I wanted as spam, which is never acceptable. I am
not saying Gmail is perfect, as I have recieved 3 spam messages into my
inbox (thats 3 out of well over 3000 emails, so a tiny percentage, .3).
What can we do to deter people from spamming us? I believe awarness is
the key. Google, Yahoo and all major web companies should advertise a
charity set up to inform people on spam, phising and the like. Have a
nice flash guide on how to spot fraudulent behaviour! Why should these
companies do this? Because it will save them money, if spammers get the
message!

      <title>Google will organise your life</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/04/16/google-will-organise-your-life/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2006 00:00:00 CDT</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/04/16/google-will-organise-your-life</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dueyfinster.eu/license/fairuse&quot; title=&quot;Fair Use&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/9618/calendar6mf.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Picture Of Google Calendar
Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google have released a calendar, as part of their mission to “Organise
the Worlds Information”. While it is what you expect from Google, the
Calendar did not impress me a whole lot. It does have an intuitive
interface, that is easy to use. It does integrate with Gmail, although
the full extent has yet to be seen, as they fall short of mentioning it
in Gmail at all, but I would expect this to change. I see great
potential for users though, and where Google is heading. They will
eventually integrate it with GoogleTalk and Gmail, producing a hybrid
interface where you can organise a conference on GoogleTalk, schedule it
on your calendar (which is syncronised with your PC and your workgroup
server [therby informing fellow employees]), submit video of it to
Google Video, write minutes with writely, email minutes with Gmail, that
mail (with document and video) being attached to the meeting on the
Calendar, which is in turn archived on your PC in Google Desktop and
your Gmail Drive. While that is only one scenario, it is very possible.
Google have already leaked information on their eagerness to hold the
entire contents of ones hard drive on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This of course leads to privacy fears, will the U.S. or Chinese
governments have access to literally anything on your computer? The
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eff.org/&quot;&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is an online
rights advocacy group, and they recently discouraged people from
downloading the latest Google Desktop, due to the fact it will backup
your information online for 30 days. You can exclude folders and files
from Google Desktops index, but this is a manual process. So where will
the future lie, and how far will Google go to get the most relevent
results? Who knows, but one thing is for sure, with their increase in
market share at expense of MSN and Yahoo, Google is here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
I am all for open standards, but they face huge problems. Not least is
lack of intergration between them. Take SIP used by VOIP providers, such
as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wengo.com/&quot;&gt;OpenWengo&lt;/a&gt;. While OpenWengo is open source,
and it is SIP, they are not helpful in informing you how to use other
clients, or dial other OpenWengo users from other networks. What I am
really talking about is the need for an all-in-one communications
program, that is multi-platform. Their is already open source code for:
Google Talk (aka Jabber), MSN, AOL, ICQ, SIP, H.323, Yahoo! but why
isn’t their an all in one client? Surely it would be easy to reimplement
some code from other programs into Ekiga (SIP, H.323) , Kopete or Gaim
(both Jabber, MSN, Yahoo, AOL and ICQ)? I know GoogleTalk is based on
SIP, so why not SIP compatability? That is poor implementation which is
fragmenting the Open Source community, how are we going to challenge
MSN’s userbase with this sort of fragmentation? That said I like Google
Talk and its way of doing things. Also it is rumoured GoogleTalk will be
interoperable with AOL at protocol level, since Google owns 5% of AOL.&lt;br /&gt;
This is also a factor across open standards, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vorbis.com/&quot;&gt;Ogg
Vorbis&lt;/a&gt;, the open alternative to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/software.html&quot;&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than
people developing a kernel to run Matrix backgrounds on an
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ipod&quot;&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt;, why not develop an Ogg Vorbis
decoder? That way nearly 80% of the digital music player market could
possibly play Ogg Vorbis, rather than the current selection of a few
iRivers, less than 1%. If Open Source is serious about the desktop and
its formats, we have to work together and stop forking our efforts! Good
News is it is getting there all the time, albeit too slow for most of
us!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/3879/c14033712l206wv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture Of Dot EU
Logo&quot; /&gt;As
tech savvy readers will be aware, dot EU is the latest domain to go into
public use. What is a domain? A domain is the name used for internet
site like
“&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dueyfinster.eu/&quot; title=&quot;Duey Finsters&quot;&gt;dueyfinster.eu&lt;/a&gt;“. It has
already sold over 1.25 million names already, this entering the third
day of the public sale. Their have been bitter critics of how it has
dealt out, with heated arguments over some domains such as Polo.eu,
which was claimed by no less than 3 entities: Volkswagen, Ralph Lauren
and Nestle. Volkswagen won out eventually, all because they got their
application in first.&lt;br /&gt;
Why is it important? Well I think it is, not only because I own one, but
because it creates a Europe wide identity, suitable for individuals and
companies. I think personally, it wasn’t handled the best way possible,
with all major companies not having control of their domains by Landrush
period (Landrush is the public sale). It will be months for
PriceWaterhouseCoopers in Belgium to sift through all documents
companies have submitted. Surpisingly, United Kingdom has registered the
most domain names and is one of the most Eurosceptic countries, while
France have only slightly registered more than other smaller countries
such as Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands.&lt;br /&gt;
Their is also speculation that Swiss and Norweigan companies may miss
out, as they are not part of the European Union (EU). Maybe this
explains why Nestle weren’t so lucky registering Polo.eu? I don’t know,
but I hope this domain brings new meaning to European citizenship, and
makes us all proud to be part of the largest trading block in the world.

      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/03/28/bebo-and-beyond</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img58.imageshack.us/img58/7163/logo6cd.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Bebo
Logo&quot; title=&quot;Bebo Logo&quot; /&gt;Do
you say Baybo or Beebo? Do you have a clue what I am on about?
Apparently 22 million of you out there will, welcome to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bebo.com/&quot; title=&quot;Bebo.com&quot;&gt;Bebo.com&lt;/a&gt; the social network growing
faster than ever! &lt;em&gt;What is a social network? Apparently *(by Google
Definitions)&lt;/em&gt;:*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The personal or professional set of relationships between individuals.
Social networks represent both a collection of ties between people and
the strength of those ties. Often used as a measure of social
“connectedness”, recognising social networks assists in determining
how information moves throughout groups, and how trust can be
established and fostered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whats interesting, is the sheer amount of Irish users on Bebo, 500,000!
Thats 1/8 of the Irish population! In a recent interview with &lt;a href=&quot;http://todayfm.com/sectional.asp?id=881&quot; title=&quot;Matt Cooper&quot;&gt;Matt
Cooper&lt;/a&gt; on
Ireland’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://todayfm.com/&quot; title=&quot;Today FM&quot;&gt;Today FM&lt;/a&gt;, Bebo CEO Michael
Birch tried to explain it himself, here are some excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bebo is a social network, and online community. People put content on
their pages, and link them to others. Worldwide we have about 22
million, in Ireland we have 500,000. Ireland has the most active
members in the world. Bebo originally started as a photo sharing
network. We work with WiredSafety.org, with Perry Afstab, to give
advice to people to stay safe. We have not have any direct issues
[related to bullying/abuse]. If you’re shy, its easier to send a
message [on Bebo]. In Ireland, we are the largest website under Google
and Yahoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To hear the interview, download the &lt;a href=&quot;http://audio.todayfm.com/audio/20060324170010.mp3&quot; title=&quot;MP3 of the Last Word&quot;&gt;MP3 of the Last
Word&lt;/a&gt;.
The interview is between 19m 15sec to 26m50sec and well worth a listen.
I have to admit I own a Bebo page, but I am trying to cut down……Caffeine
or Bebo….ugggh such a hard choice!&lt;/p&gt;

Logo&quot; /&gt;Only
now is it truly becoming clear, their is &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/applications/0,39020384,39256661,00.htm&quot;&gt;serious money in Open
Source&lt;/a&gt;.
With &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; reported to have made tens of
millions of dollars. One blogger reported 70m was made by the
corporation, with a Mozilla insider confirming thats a reasonable
ballpark figure. Christopher Blizzard, board member of Mozilla, had this
to say on his blog: &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Blizzard added that an earnings figure of $72m (£41m) quoted on some
&amp;gt; blogs was incorrect. “I won’t comment on the dollar amount except to
&amp;gt; say that it’s [$72m] not correct, though not off by an order of
&amp;gt; magnitude. I also won’t comment on sources of that money, except to
&amp;gt; say that some of the assertions that I’ve seen in the comments are
&amp;gt; pretty far off, both in terms of numbers and sources,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One obvious source of the money is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.ie/&quot;&gt;Google Inc.&lt;/a&gt;,
which Firefox gives prominance&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/images/template/moz-com-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mozilla
Logo&quot; /&gt; to as the
default search engine, of the open source browser. Jason Calacanis, the
chief executive of blogging network Weblogs, wrote in his blog that an
unnamed source at BarCampLA told him:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Calacanis claimed that when a Firefox user does a Google search using
&amp;gt; the browser’s search box, Mozilla receives approximately 80 percent of
&amp;gt; the ad revenue from any associated ad clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty impressive for a company, which only earned 5m in 2004. The
continued success in&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.abondance.com/Bin/Firefox-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Firefox
Logo&quot; /&gt; Firefox is shown in
the the 10-fold increase of Mozilla’s profits. Most People wish Mozilla
well, with some questioning the Corporations commitment to better
development, in favour of more lucrative contracts, this, of course, is
denied by everyone at Mozilla Corp. Only time will tell! In the
meantime, rumours are abound, Mozilla is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.builder.com/manage/work/0,39026594,39304018,00.htm&quot;&gt;distribute its

      <title>Just Klik it!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest complaints of Linux is that software doesn’t install
to well, or is very difficult to install. “Dependency Hell” (When
software relies on other bits of software to work), used to be quite
commonplace. Ubuntu has cleaned a lot of dependency hell up, and a new
program for installing software from the internet, is included in the
new version, due to be released 1st June 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when I discovered a little gem called
“&lt;a href=&quot;http://klik.atekon.de/&quot;&gt;Klik&lt;/a&gt;” for many Linux distributions. Simply
lookup the piece of software you need, click on it and you have it! No
need to install! It places the whole program on the desktop, so it is
easily deletable and easily transferable. For example, if you have an
office application, and your friend doesn’t, simply copy that file on
desktop to your usb key or a cd, and copy to friends pc, done and dusted
- Your friend has the whole application! This is an obvious feature
bonus over current Windows version, XP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their is some teething problems, some applications fail to work, and in
Ubuntu it has a dependency of libstdc++, a library of files to make it
work. Easy instructions to install Klik are included on their website,
though. It seems they are seeking co-operation from Ubuntu aneedsd other
distributions to iron out problems, which is always a good sign. Klik
also trys to have “bleeding edge” stable versions of software, so in
distrobutions not upgraded frequently, this can cause more problems. Out
of ten, I’d give &lt;a href=&quot;http://klik.atekon.de/&quot;&gt;Klik&lt;/a&gt; an 8.5, as it still
needs ironing-out. But then again I have been using the web for over ten
years, so novice users may feel different on its ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Virtual Ubuntu</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/03/10/virtual-ubuntu/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2006 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/03/10/virtual-ubuntu</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So you have heard of Ubuntu, maybe they have even shipped you a free
disc or you have&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vmware.com/img/ubuntu.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Ubuntu Logo&quot; /&gt;
downloaded one? Like most users, even advanced PC users, they get
nervous about installing Linux and afraid of what they might have to
learn. Touted as the brighest star, Ubuntu really does outshine other
Linuxes, with usability, features and great range of software. Now you
can try Ubuntu on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I try it, is what I always get asked, without risk to my
computer? First of all, you need to download &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/vmware/Ubuntu-5.10.zip&quot;&gt;Ubuntu
Virtual&lt;/a&gt;. This in
laymans terms, is Ubuntu compressed into one file. Think of that file as
the “Tape”, now you need the “Tape Player”, along comes &lt;a href=&quot;http://download3.vmware.com/software/vmplayer/VMware-player-1.0.1-19317.exe&quot; title=&quot;http://download3.vmware.com/software/vmplayer/VMware-player-1.0.1-19317.exe&quot;&gt;VMWare
Player&lt;/a&gt;.
Simply install VMware Player, and then find the “Ubuntu Tape” file, in
VMware Player. Thats it! No installation required of Ubuntu. &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vmware.com/img/logo_top.gif&quot; alt=&quot;VMware
Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, you can use VMware player to emulate Windows on Ubuntu. Also
you can try the LiveCD of Ubuntu, which you insert at time you turn on
your computer and it loads Ubuntu, without affecting your PC or any
files on it. Both install and live disc of Ubuntu can be &lt;a href=&quot;http://shipit.ubuntu.com/&quot; title=&quot;http://shipit.ubuntu.com&quot;&gt;ordered free
of charge.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7231752728434532377-5286736642047829716?l=neil.grogan.ie&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Linux VS. Windows</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/03/06/linux-vs-windows/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2006 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/03/06/linux-vs-windows</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use Linux, I also use Windows. I see the merits of the two, as they
are different. Most people don’t see this distinction, that although the
two OSes do many of the same functions, they remain lightyears apart. I
have to admit I preach Linux to the hilt, I shouldn’t, but I do. I get
skeptical Windows users who ask me what Linux does better, and I am
stuck for an answer, as it does a lot of tasks better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~ap29/partitions.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Windows Vs.
Linux&quot; /&gt;For example,
half life of Windows vs. Ubuntu (My Distro of Choice), Ubuntu wins hands
down. Its the way that its very hard to install stuff to decrease system
speed, yet on Windows it is terrifingly easy. I am on my cousins
computer at the moment, sure enough its at the year stage and takes ages
to load anything. Its got the usual bloatware, such as a very bulky
antivirus/firewall, they own an iPod which starts iTunes and Quicktime,
Use MSN &amp;amp; Skype and other stuff that start automatically, which is why
Windows is crippled, they all have the computers resources for
breakfast! I get one of two answers, either A) Sure I use all of them,
thats convienience! or B) Sure you can switch it off in the programs
preferences. My answer to A) No it isn’t, you try run a game, or office
suite, you soon find you won’t be able to listen to that song in the
background on iTunes, or watch that movie on Quicktime, or message those
friends of yours on MSN, you soon find you can’t do any of them, and to
B) Most users don’t want the hassle to turn it off, why can’t their
computer “Just Work”, like Windows users are fond of pointing out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My issue with Microsoft, is that, in the course to make software
accessible, they left security and their morals at the door. In Linux,
we have a permissions system, you don’t have permission to modify a
file, though. On Windows every user gets equal access, but this means so
does every Virus and piece of spyware. What good is the Banking document
if the whole world knows its contents? What Linux does best is it
focuses on Software, and quality is the bottom line. If a feature isn’t
ready, it will not be released to the public, full stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still I get Windows people that refuse to budge, even though concerns
are well documented. I havesome things to say to them, it doesn’t matter
what you think, let me illustrate this to be clear: Their are 900
Million pc’s in the world, of which 90% use Windows. In India and China,
lie 1/3 of this earths population ( 2 Billion ), most popular OS? Linux.
Give it twenty years, when wealth increases, this will be reflected when
Windows share dwindles. Case in Point: South America: the Brazilian
Govt. has switched totally to Linux, now the countries most popular OS,
this trend is continuing across South America, buoyed by
Anti-Americanism. Also Africa, the worlds poorest continent is set to
see huge influxes of Linux wind up laptops. This continues to the
developed world albeit at a much slower pace, with most European
countries registering a decent linux percentage and even the European
commision talking about Europe wide Open Source intiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who Will Win? The average computer user, as software gets cheaper,
choices and competition become more apparent.Even if your a loyal
Windows user, I argue you try and encourage Linux developement, as in
the end it will force Microsoft to be more competitive and make better
software. Computing is not a luxury any more, it is an essential way of
life, and its due to change more lives this century than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gallery, Riots and Policy Change</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/03/02/gallery-riots-and-policy-change/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2006 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/03/02/gallery-riots-and-policy-change</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I
can’t believe I only had one post in February! A lot has happened since
then, with Danish cartoons, Dublin Riots and a few policy changes to the
site. First of all the cartoons, I mean, whats all the fuss?
Christianity is banned in Saudi Arabia and Muslims in the middle east
just don’t get the idea of ‘free press’. No one should be allowed to
immigrate to the western world, if they do not hold the core values
which we hold, such as human rights, free of expression/press and other
values. Should we worry about the middle east? Not at all, they’re
behind the times, their loss. Why is it that movies which parody
Christianity are so popular with Christians (like Monty Python)? We have
evolved and can tolerate jokes and laugh at ourselves, many, but not all
Muslims have not learned to do this, but they will, its called
evolution, and sooner or later, it will hit the middle east. I am not
defending the Cartoons, and I know Muslims do not produce images of
Muhammad, and offense to this, I can understand. But they need to relax,
maybe try some of the many drugs they like to export to us? &lt;br /&gt;
I could not but laugh at all the scumbags fighting each other in Dublin!
In the end all the unionists got on their buses and went back, being
entirely safe. Now if that doesn’t make you support the new prison in
North Dublin, I don’t know what will. I was reading some of the free
newspapers and they claim that the underprivileged in Irish Society were
showing the Government up, I disagree, all they wanted was notoriety
with their friends for “wreckin de gaff” in Dublin&amp;rsquo;s famous streets. I
say we make them all do community service in some of Belfast&amp;rsquo;s most
staunchest unionist estates, maybe that might revert their need to be
“mad scones”? I fully supported the march, even if it was discriminatory
against Catholics (Only for Protestant Victims of IRA), as every one has
the right to march, whether unionists, republicans or socialists (wait
aren’t the last two the same thing? I am confused!). &lt;br /&gt;
Finally some updates to the site, I have reversed the ‘free edit’
policy, now you have to login to edit articles. Although vandalism was
by no means rampant, I felt it easier if people took the 2 minutes to
register, if they want to contribute. Also, we now have RSS feeds!
Powered by feedburner, it lets me track readership and other useful
values. I am just working on getting listed on all major blog sites.
Also I am currently installing a gallery to house my photos of Germany,
expect it soon! &lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;

      <title>German Trip</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/02/13/german-trip/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2006 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/02/13/german-trip</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently travelled to Munich, Germany on a recent
exchange (1st-9th Feb, 2006). Not knowing what to expect, I found a very
different Germany from the text book one you read about (Bavarian Trad
Dress, Beer-drinking, Pretzel Eating, Sausage loving etc!). Of course
all of these elements were present, but I think a modern German society
closely reflects American one, in a lot of ways. Germans are the largest
group by ethnicity in United States, so maybe its just German culture
prevalent in America? &lt;br /&gt;
Here is a short explanation of what I found as I wrote to Family,
explaining how I was getting on:&lt;br /&gt;
Their school system is very different. Students talk over teachers, play
with their mobile phones or throw things at one another! Its a continous
assessment system with A-F represented by numbers 1-6.&lt;br /&gt;
I have had a trip to Friedberg (Watch capitol of Europe once) and a
brief visit to Augsburg(guided tour with trip). Also visited Dachau KZ
(Konzantrationslager - Concentration Camp) its very sad, the words
“Arbeit Mich Frei” (Work will set you free) are on the front gate. Lots
of people were there, but you could literally hear a pin drop.&lt;br /&gt;
I also visited Bavarian Alps, got a ski lift to a traditional restaurant
they were all dressed in green and white! Got loads of photos! English
usage is very heavy, most Germans have a good command of it, the radio
plays exact same songs as ours.&lt;br /&gt;
I am also getting on great with all the girls (mostly girls chose to
go), now that I have seen what there really like, there even sounder
outside of school. I get a bus to school with Jens (My Exchange
Student), sometimes his mother drives us. It is very cold here -10c most
of the time. Snow can be upto 1m high, then again I am told they get
nice summers! Turkish influence is very noticeable, every town nearly
has a kebab shop. Houses here are a lot cheaper(than Ireland)! Approx 3
times size of my house is only €20,000 more.&lt;br /&gt;
I should have photos soon!

      <title>Wiki, Awards and Wifi</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/01/22/wiki-awards-and-wifi/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2006 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/01/22/wiki-awards-and-wifi</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well the last couple of weeks have
been interesting! You will notice the website is now a wiki based on
Wikipedias engine, metawiki. I had a load of problems with making the
theme work with a wiki with loads of menus. I think I did well
considering I only spent about 3 days doing it. The code still aint how
I want it and some features were lost, such as rss and del.icio.us
bookmarks. But pages are now easier than ever to navigate and comment on
which brings more features. &lt;br /&gt;
I also won an award for webbdesign for &lt;a href=&quot;http://colaistechiarain.com/&quot; title=&quot;http://colaistechiarain.com&quot;&gt;Colaiste
Chiarain&lt;/a&gt;
website. It was run for second level students in IT Tallaght, Dublin. I
scooped top prize with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dueyfinster.com/User:Mp3guy&quot; title=&quot;Mp3guy&quot;&gt;Thomas
Whelan&lt;/a&gt;, which was €400
or €200 each. As promised I went to Dublin to St. Stephens Green
Shopping Centre and tested out my &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_770&quot; title=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia 770&quot;&gt;Nokia
770&lt;/a&gt;
. I failed to find the cafe that reportedly offered free wifi, so
instead I settled for cafe kylemore, bought a coffee (€2.30) and got a
half an hour of surfing time. It was cheaper to buy a coffee and surf
than pay BitBuzz the service provider for a half an hour which would
have cost €3! We certainly do live in rip-off Ireland, anyone in doubt
needs a head examination! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;

      <title>New Year, Lets Review!</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2006/01/06/new-year-lets-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well another year has
passed, so I thought I’d make a short recap of it, and tell you what I
am looking forward to in 2006. The year was firmly in the hands of
mother nature as we saw in both Pakistan, New Orleans/Gulf of Mexico and
the Tsunami’s after effects. International consensus was reached at the
G8 as London was being bombed - not by the IRA, but by their new enemies
in the middle east. Iran esculated its pressure on the world by resuming
its nuclear activities. George W. Bush took office in January, much to
the distaste of the Daily Mirror in the UK, who scored their most famous
headline, “How Could 59,054,087 People, Be So Dumb?”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Good Year For…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For Natural Disasters (Katrina, Earthquake)&lt;br /&gt;
George W. Bush&lt;br /&gt;
Daily Mirror (Bush Headline)&lt;br /&gt;
Charles and Camilla (Wedding)&lt;br /&gt;
Live 8 and Bob Geldof&lt;br /&gt;
U2 (How to Dismantle’s Continued Success)&lt;br /&gt;
Palestine (Regained Control of Gaza Strip)&lt;br /&gt;
Irish Soccer Team (Knocked out of World Cup)&lt;br /&gt;
Chelsea (Win Premiership) and Liverpool (Win Champions League)&lt;br /&gt;
** Bad Year**&lt;br /&gt;
Catholic Church (Fearns Sex Scandal, Unpopularity of New Pope)&lt;br /&gt;
Michael Jackson (Didn’t he deserve it?)&lt;br /&gt;
New Orleans&lt;br /&gt;
Kashmir (Pakistani Part)&lt;br /&gt;
Israel (Pullout of Gaza Strip)&lt;br /&gt;
Liam Lawlor (Died in Car Crash, and Misreports of Prostitution)&lt;br /&gt;
Ukraine (400% Gas Hikes, Ouch!)&lt;br /&gt;
Manchester United (Glazer Takeover, Roy Keane Leaves, Vodafone Withdraw
Sponsorship) Broadband in Ireland (Still one of the lowest take ups in
Europe)&lt;br /&gt;
2005 was a good year for Ireland, as continued growth keeps jobless
figures one of the lowest in Europe. What do we have to look forward to
in 2006?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2006….&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Wifi, set to increase ten fold Playstation 3 and Nintendo Revolution due
to be released Government Savings Scheme Matures Dublins newest radio
station, Phantom FM to come online The End of Big Brother Intel’s new
DVD lookalike Computers St. Patricks Day (Again) Dublin Pubs losing
money (Yay!) Skype introducing Video Rise of VOIP, killing off Eircom
Chewing Gum Tax (dont we need it?) More rises in cost of living Well
thats what 2006 may hold, so lets hope some of the better things come
true! It’s gonna be another great year for technology and gadgets, with
more MP3’s predicted to be sold in 2006 than ever before, lets just hope
Time Magazine doesn’t give iPod gadget of the century this year! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;

      <title>Million Dollars, Nice!</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2005/12/30/million-dollars-nice/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2005 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>
      <author>Neil Grogan</author>
      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2005/12/30/million-dollars-nice</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A student in England has almost reached his target of one million dollars, 
and he is only 21! He came up with the idea after jotting down ideas before
he went to bed on how to become a millionaire before he went to university. 
Then he came up with the million-dollar idea, sell pixels at USD $1 a piece 
on his homepage, MillionDollarHomepage.com . This man is Alex Tew, hailed
as an advertising genius by the many companies who are using his site to 
make Internet history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex believes he can make his goal by the end of 31st December 2005. 
In fact as of writing this, he has already made USD 936,700. The student
says advertisers get to keep their ads for a period of five years from 
purchase and he says he will use the money he has made to guarantee it.
Alex has said he has already got numerous job offers from companies aiming
to secure his money making talent.Alex is doing business management
course at Nottingham and needed GBP7000 a year to complete his studies. 
He is understandably overwhelmed by the success he has achieved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is just nuts. I am in a state of disbelief. It&amp;rsquo;s like 
Monopoly money but then I look at my bank account and there is a lot of 
cash in it. The method is simple, his website is made up of one page 
divided into 10,000 boxes, each 100 pixels in size. Companies can buy 
one or more boxes for USD $100 each and cover it with a logo, which, 
when clicked on, transports web users to the customers own site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures add up with the site now carrying over 240 advertisements 
and has 30,000 hits a day. Even the actor Jack Black, star of School of 
Rock and Shallow Hal, is using the site to advertise his band Tenacious D. 
The British National Union of Students say 90% of students are in debt. 
But the only money worries Alex now has is what to spend it all on. He has
already splashed out on a black mini for himself, as he thinks of what to
do with his new found fortune.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Notes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sketch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It runs on Linux, making it totally extendable. It even has its own
developer site at maemo.org, where applications can be downloaded. Hot 
on my list were Doom (the Game) and GAIM (Instant Messenger, uses Google
Talk, AOL, MSN, Yahoo, Jabber, IRC, etc). Unfortunately their is no Skype 
for Nokia 770 just yet, but hopefully it will be here soon. Nokia has 
promised an upgrade in 2006, that will include VOIP, such as skype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All major formats have good support on the Nokia 770, including: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Audio: MP3, MPEG4-AAC, WAV, AMR, MP2, [OGG - (With download from Maemo)]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Image: JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, PNG, Animated GIF format, SVG-tiny, ICO&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Video: MPEG1, MPEG4, Real Video, H.263, AVI, 3GP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I took it out of the package, within minutes I was surfing, 
the only delay was trying to find MAC address (as my router uses access 
control list) which I eventually found underneath the battery. I thought 
this was a bit odd as Mac Address&amp;rsquo; are easily attainable when it is connected
to a network, so hopefully Nokia will revise this! The media card is also 
only 64mb, which gives a total free of about 108mb space. RS-MMC (The media
card it uses) only come in prohibitive sizes and are expensive, this will
most likely change if it is widely used. The stand that comes with
it is the most difficult part of the package! It took me 20mins to try 
and figure out how to use the stand. All in all it is not a great stand,
just two lumps of plastic. The battery seems respectable at the moment, 
with a predicted time of three hours battery life and seven days standby. 
I got a bit more then three hours when I first opened it, it worked out 
just a little over 3hrs 20mins. Not bad for a 2/3 full battery Nokia packs
with new devices! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, reviews are excellent for it. A lot of noise is made 
of the fact that it is so customisable and that all of the programs for it 
are free! Abiword is also a must have, it opens and edits documents. It compared
to other tablets is quite cheap, at about €369 including delivery, in Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be posting updates on my free Wifi testing campaign soon, its all about
to kick off! I will let you know best free wifi spots in and around Dublin area!
Anywhere you think I should go? Please tell me, it will be useful!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Google Video</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What a fantastic service Google now offer with their Google Video platform. 
There are a couple of reasons why I like it, mainly because it is available to 
upload your videos on all platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac) and is available 
on Mozilla-based browsers (Firefox, Netscape), Opera and Internet Explorer. 
This is important in creating a better all round user experience. If only Yahoo!
would follow Googles example and open up Launch Cast to other browsers besides
an outdated version of Netscape and Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a criticism of Google Video also, and that is it takes too long to 
approve videos (8 days in my case), the should at least give an expected 
time-frame and allow notification through email when your video is accepted 
and available live on Google. Other than that the service is pretty good and
as it is still in the Beta testing phase, Google have promised to make it 
better. This could be a precursor to Google trying to launch its own media-for-sale
in the form of Music videos, who knows? One things for sure, it is going to steal
the thunder from launchcast. My first video I have uploaded is below, it is
called &lt;a href=&quot;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3292925657159260597&quot;&gt;We Hate Coogie Bear : The Motion Picture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In case you have never looked at it, Click Online is the flagship 
technology program for the BBC. It broadcasts on the Internet and can 
be viewed even on a 56k modem. I have been watching click online for 
over a year and a half now, I first saw it on BBC World, while holidaying 
in Portugal. It also broadcasts on BBC News 24 at 7am on a Sunday morning 
(I have never seen it at this time!). Although by its nature a technical 
program, it is very much aimed at the average PC user and so most things 
are explained fully.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Eurosceptics</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2005/12/17/eurosceptics/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2005 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2005/12/17/eurosceptics</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The British Press annoys me so much, they way they constantly get it 
wrong across the board about the EU. I am a fond supporter of the EU 
for all its faults and cracks. But I love freedom of the press and 
like organisations who uphold basic journalistic standards, such as 
the BBC. This leads me onto the evil man behind it all, Rupert Murdoch
owner of The Sun, BSkyB Television, The Times and other media outlets.
It seems all he pushes is his agenda, whether it be the Bush Right-Christian
agenda on Fox in the US or Eurosceptic view in his British interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I speak of this because of the shocking facts I discovered on an EU website,
by the commissioner for the EU in The UK, its at: 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cec.org.uk/press/myths/index.htm&quot; title=&quot;http://www.cec.org.uk/press/myths/index.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.cec.org.uk/press/myths/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;
Honestly some of the things that are published are unbelievable! One can only 
guess Murdoch motives (maybe to foster the &lt;em&gt;special relationship&lt;/em&gt; between 
UK and USA even further?) Who knows? One thing is for certain, the US resent the
EU bargaining power and good relations with China and Russia. One to hit the 
headlines was US supposedly using spy planes to ferry people to be tortured in 
countries such as Egypt (Known for bad Human Rights record).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think British People do not realise how beneficial giving money to aid 
development is, take my own country , Ireland for instance. Forty years ago 
we were a backward nation with no prospects, Now we are one of the richest in 
Europe and will become a contributor to the EU soon. We should aim to replicate
the &lt;em&gt;Ireland Effect&lt;/em&gt; in the new accession countries to help the develop. If they 
grow, it means an enlarged market for British made products, thereby helping 
generate more wealth - what goes around comes around, this is not a battle for 
identity with France or Germany any more!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While using instant messenger I had a brainwave, what will the tech
landscape look like in the future? So here is What I think could happen: 
IBM will buy Sun MicroSystems and make a new opensource OS, it will be 
based on Ubuntu. Microsoft will purchase AOL and roll out its products 
on the Web, such as MS Office, it will have a slow start to Vista, 
but it will pick up through peoples eagerness to buy the latest hardware. 
Google will buy Opera, invest in Mozilla and consolidate Opera into Mozilla, 
it will also buy Adobe (for their PDF format), get its way to publish an 
online bookstore through Google Book Search. Yahoo will continue to buy 
extra companies to add to its list of a zillion services, such as Flickr 
and Del.icio.us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Post me comments!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a throat infection, so I get a week off!! I went to the doctor
and I am on vibramycin antibiotics. I was coughing blood (not nearly
as nasty as it sounds). Now I can get some relaxation in before Christmas!!
I hope to do a guide to restricted formats on Ubuntu soon, especially 
W32 Codecs and how to get all the good formats it offers (Divx, MPEG1-4,
Windows Media, Quicktime Media and RealMedia)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should all be using free formats, but everyone uses proprietary formats. 
If anything makes the transition to Linux that bit smoother, its the ability
to play and view all their media.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wireless, New Design and Web Services</title>
      <link>http://neil.grogan.ie/2005/12/10/wireless-new-design-and-web-services/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2005 00:00:00 CST</pubDate>

      <guid>http://neil.grogan.ie/2005/12/10/wireless-new-design-and-web-services</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new and improved Duey Finsters. As I mentioned before,
 I hope to receive a Nokia 770 Internet Tablet soon, so I will be checking
the free wireless services offered by Eircom in Dublin and at McDonalds
restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed the new look and this revamped blog. You may also 
question where has Duey Finsters Web Services gone? It is still here, but 
me and Thomas Whelan, who run it, cannot decide on a name. Maybe you all 
could help us out? Since well over 97% of all the words in the dictionary
are registered as dot coms, we have no clue what to call ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a unique name, that could be trademarked, so anything
you suggest, you give us permission to use royalty-free (We might throw you
a million, when we make ours).Once we get a name, the dot com will be 
registered and a totally new site will be designed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also new is a guides section, which will be part of the blog. The idea is 
I can write guides so other people can see how easy it is to actually do stuff. 
I plan  to write a guide (Including pictures) for Linux and Windows using 
encrypted mail. On Linux, I will show both command and KGPG (the KDE graphical 
key maker) and on windows I will use WinPT (Windows Privacy Tools).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Music and Bookmarks section are going to take a while for me to implement
properly, as I am still practicing using PHP to render XML, but it should be fun.
They both use feeds, Last.fm for music and del.icio.us for bookmarks. That reminds
me, I just saw del.icio.us was bought by Yahoo!, I hope they do not ruin it like
they did to Flickr and stick their name and advertising in every conceivable
space on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
